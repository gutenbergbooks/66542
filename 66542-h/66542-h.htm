<small>A BOLD PROPOSAL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;You say he cannot travel to-day, doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible, Mr. Carter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would be in a drawing-room on the Pullman, and
every care would be taken to make the journey easy for
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The surgeon shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;He would have his own servant, Phillips, to attend
him,&#8221; persisted Nick Carter. &#8220;This is Prince Marcos, you
know, Doctor Sloane. You&#8217;ve heard of him, and I&#8217;ve explained
that it is essential for him to be in the country
of which he is the ruler by the eighteenth of this month.
He has only five days now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He could make it in the five days, by continuous traveling,&#8221;
still pressed the detective. &#8220;I realize that he would
be taking some risk. But when it is considered that the
very existence of his country depends on his getting there
by a certain date, I doubt whether any one has the moral
right to stop him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctor Sloane shrugged his shoulders. He was one of
the distinguished surgeons in New York, and he was accustomed
to being obeyed. Even a prince was not important
enough in his eyes to dispute his professional
commands.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the moral right, Mr. Carter,&#8221; intoned the doctor,
in his most impressive manner, &#8220;that, it seems to me, is
beside the matter. I tell you, as a surgeon, that a man
who has just been shot in the chest, and has narrowly
escaped a puncture of the pericardium, must lie still for
a more or less protracted period, if he intends ever to get
up at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel quite well,&#8221; suddenly interposed the man in the
bed. &#8220;I can travel easily, Mr. Carter. Make the doctor
understand that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Mr. Marcos,&#8221; answered Nick Carter, as he
held up a hand of warning to the patient not to talk.
&#8220;I think the doctor does understand our position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand that if you let this Mr. Marcos get up
to-day, or this week, or next, I will not be responsible
for his life,&#8221; interrupted Doctor Sloane. &#8220;His temperature
is nearly a hundred and rising, and he is too weak
to talk, to say nothing of his getting up.&#8221;</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that the surgeon spoke the
truth. Prince Marcos, ruler of Joyalita, the Caribbean
principality, was in bad physical condition.</p>

<p>He had been preparing to go home, to take part in an
important gathering of the officers of his government,
when somebody had fired a shot at him from ambush as
he strolled in the grounds of his temporary home, Crownledge,
on the Hudson River, and had brought him down.</p>

<p>If there had been anybody with Prince Marcos when
his hidden enemy tried to kill him, the miscreant might
have been captured. But the prince was alone. Naturally,
nothing could be found of the would-be assassin when
the grounds were searched, for it was then half an hour
after the shooting, and Marcos was in bed.</p>

<p>Phillips, his valet, had heard the shot, and knowing
that the prince&#8217;s cousin, Prince Miguel, with Don Solado,
prime minister of Joyalita, had made attempts on his life
before, in New York, he had suspected these men again.</p>

<p>Nicholas Carter, the famous detective, had been telephoned
for. He had come racing up in his high-powered
motor car soon after the eminent surgeon&mdash;with the aid
of one of much less note, as well as a trained nurse&mdash;had
extracted the bullet.</p>

<p>Doctor Sloane had just given his decision now that
the patient must stay in bed for two weeks at least&mdash;perhaps
much longer.</p>

<p>To the surgeon&#8217;s disgust, the patient insisted that he
must get up at once. He had to take a long journey
into Central America, he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>Strangely enough, Nicholas Carter, the famous detective&mdash;whose
knowledge of medicine and surgery was great
enough to have made him a successful practitioner if he
had cared to follow a doctor&#8217;s career&mdash;had backed up
Prince Marcos in his wild purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt that, according to all precedent, a man
in my condition should stay in bed,&#8221; conceded Marcos.
&#8220;But I shall have to go down to Joyalita at once, nevertheless.&#8221;</p>

<p>The surgeon turned away, with his favorite shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can say no more,&#8221; he declared, in an offended
tone. &#8220;I&#8217;ve given you my honest professional opinion. It
is more than an opinion&mdash;it is a conviction. If you choose
to commit suicide, it is no affair of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctor Sloane was not accustomed to people flying in
his face. So he vouchsafed Prince Marcos merely a curt
nod of farewell, and stalked out of the bedchamber.</p>

<p>Nick Carter followed him to the hall and closed the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, doctor, I know it is important for Mr. Marcos
to go down to Central America at once. He should have
started already, and would have done so but for this unfortunate
accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Accident?&#8221; ejaculated Doctor Sloane, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will call it that for the present,&#8221; returned Nick
Carter. &#8220;Anyhow, the fact that he has enemies who would
shoot him down in cold blood in his own home indicates
that it is imperative for him to go. If it were not, men
would not be trying to kill him to keep him back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may all be,&#8221; conceded the doctor. &#8220;No doubt
it is, when you say so, Mr. Carter. But that is entirely
outside of my province. I came here to save his life,
and I have told you what will happen if he gets up
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a strong constitution,&#8221; pleaded Nick Carter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he has, or he wouldn&#8217;t be alive now,&#8221; snapped
Sloane. &#8220;But if he moves before next week, at the
earliest&mdash;well, the consequences be on his own head.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, Doctor Sloane marched out
of the house to his motor car, and was gone.</p>

<p>Nick Carter went back to the sick room and gazed
thoughtfully at the flushed face and tossing head on the
pillow. As he looked, a thought revolved in his mind which
he admitted to be audacious, but which would not be
banished, no matter how outrageous it might seem.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do doctors know about affairs of state?&#8221; suddenly
burst from the injured man&#8217;s impatient lips, as he
turned his eyes, bright with fever, upon the detective. &#8220;If
I start on that nine-o&#8217;clock train to-night, I can make
good connections, and get down to Joyalita in time to beat
those wretches. You will help me, Carter, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will certainly try to bring to justice the men who
tried to murder you,&#8221; replied Nick Carter. &#8220;Don Solado,
your prime minister of state&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A treacherous old rascal!&#8221; put in Marcos.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he is,&#8221; assented Nick. &#8220;And your cousin,
Prince Miguel, who would like to step into your shoes as
ruler of your country. He and Solado are both interested
in preventing your reaching Joyalita. Whether they
would kill you to keep you away remains to be seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am convinced they would. I feel sure that one of
them fired that shot at me. Or, if he did not actually
do it himself, he hired one of those thugs, who can be
procured in any large city, to do it for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It comes to the same thing,&#8221; remarked Nick Carter.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is nothing, after all,&#8221; went on Marcos hurriedly.
&#8220;The thing is that the revolutionary party in
Joyalita are to hold a meeting on the eighteenth of this
month, at which they will practically give the country into
the hands of our neighbor, Carita. That is the scheme. If
I am there, I must sign the reply to Carita&#8217;s proposition,
and, of course, it will be in the negative.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you are not there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the president of the council, who is a secret enemy
of mine&mdash;as I have just found out&mdash;will sign it for me,
and he will accept the other side&#8217;s proposal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a difficult situation,&#8221; murmured Nick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Difficult or not, it must be solved,&#8221; broke in Marcos.
&#8220;I intend to go. The capital of Joyalita is Penza, and I
must be there at twelve noon on the eighteenth.&#8221;</p>

<p>He forced himself to a sitting posture and threw aside
the bedclothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Marcos!&#8221; protested Nick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to stop me, Carter! My mind is made
up!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Marcos&#8217; body was not as strong as his will.</p>

<p>As he swung himself out of bed and put his feet to
the floor, the pallor of faintness came over his face, and
he would have pitched forward in a heap had not the detective
caught him.</p>

<p>Lifting the insensible man upon the bed again, and
pulling the clothes over him, Nick Carter applied remedies
which soon brought him back to consciousness, although
his disappointment was pitiful.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; he wailed. &#8220;What shall I do?
The scoundrels have beaten me, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick gave him a spoonful of stimulant, and, as the
color came back increasingly into his face, Marcos continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care for myself. But it breaks my heart to
see my little country sold into bondage for the benefit
of a handful of rascals who would sell their own mothers
if they got their price. What can I do, Carter?&#8221;</p>

<p>He held out his hot hand appealingly to the strong,
cool detective at the side of his bed, and Nick Carter,
taking the hand in his, resolved to carry out the audacious
purpose already referred to, let the result be what it
might.</p>

<p>Nick strode up and down the room for some minutes,
turning over in his mind the scheme that had come to
him. Once he stopped before the mirror on the dresser
and contemplated his own face steadily for several seconds.</p>

<p>As he turned away, there was a confident smile softening
his resolute lips, and he nodded as if inwardly
assenting to some suggestion unheard by anybody but
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me, your highness!&#8221; he said, stopping at
the side of Prince Marcos&#8217; bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop &#8216;your highness,&#8217; Carter,&#8221; begged Marcos impatiently.
&#8220;Call me &#8216;Mr. Marcos,&#8217; if you like, but leave
out the royalty. We are in New York, and I am quite
content to be a plain &#8216;Mr.&#8217; while here. But what were
you going to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just this,&#8221; replied the detective, bending over the bed,
so that the trained nurse, who had just come into the
room, should not overhear. &#8220;There is one way in which
we can save your country. It will mean trickery&mdash;a
fraud, if you will.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>The trained nurse left the room, and Nick Carter quietly
turned the key in the lock.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Marcos.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at me. Don&#8217;t you think many people would
say I was Prince Marcos if I declared that to be my
name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they would. No one could tell the difference,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcos stopped, and a wild expression of hope came
into his fever-brightened eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that you would&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he went on, and
stopped again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would go in your place to Penza, in Joyalita, and
do for Prince Marcos what his enemies have prevented
his doing for himself,&#8221; declared Nick Carter firmly.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br />


<small>THE DEPARTURE FOR PENZA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>There was no other word spoken for an appreciable
space of time. Prince Marcos could hardly comprehend
the possibility of the plan, and was silent. Nick waited
for him to say something.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think it could not be done if it were any
one but you, Carter,&#8221; were the broken words that came
from Marcos at last. &#8220;But I can see only success if
you undertake the thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be success,&#8221; returned Nick gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Now let me tell you what you must do.
When I left Joyalita I wore a small mustache. I shaved
it off before I got to New York. Will you kindly hand
me my coat&mdash;or take the small packet of letters, fastened
by a band, in the inside pocket? That will be
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick obeyed, and Marcos took from one of the envelopes
a photograph of himself as he had appeared
before taking off the mustache.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Carter,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I looked a little different
when wearing that. Could you not put one on like that?
It would make your disguise absolutely perfect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do that, of course,&#8221; answered the detective.
&#8220;Will you lend me this photograph? I will get a mustache,
and make up my face with the photo as a guide.
That is a common method with professional actors when
they are to represent some well-known personage&mdash;such
as President Lincoln, Disraeli, or <i>Taffy</i>, in &#8216;Trilby.&#8217; They
generally &#8216;make-up&#8217; from a portrait of the original. I can
get myself exact, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can have the photo. And you&#8217;d better take Phillips
with you. He will be a great help, because he knows
Joyalita and its people as well as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. I could hardly undertake it without Phillips,&#8221;
answered the detective. &#8220;I intended to ask you
for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who else will you have with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall take my principal assistant, Chick, in the guise
of a medical attendant, and my second man, Patrick Garvan,
in place of your late servant, Jason, who managed
to get burned to death during the last attempt of the
gentle Miguel to keep you away from Joyalita.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you will have three people with you,&#8221; observed
Marcos. &#8220;That will make four in the party, and it ought
to be strong enough to throw off Solado and Miguel, if
they should try any tricks on you as you go along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which they are likely to do,&#8221; said Nick.</p>

<p>Marcos fumbled under his pillow and brought out a
chamois leather bag which he had worn around his neck
under his clothing, but had taken off when his valet had
undressed him.</p>

<p>Phillips knew that his employer always had this bag
under his pillow. He often had assisted him to remove
the cord from his neck without making any comment.
Any well-trained valet would do that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is something you must take, Carter,&#8221; said
Marcos.</p>

<p>He fumbled in the bag, and took out a richly jeweled
watch and diamond fob. Laying them on the counterpane,
he regarded the fire and luster of the precious stones
admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;This watch is known as the Seal of Gijon,&#8221; he remarked
quietly. &#8220;It has been handed down in my family
through a dozen generations, and is the insignia of
the reigning house of Joyalita. You see that it is old-fashioned
in design. But it is an accurate timekeeper,
and its value, merely as gold and gems, is several thousand
dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; nodded the detective. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen the
watch before, you will remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember. But here is something that perhaps
you have not seen,&#8221; continued Marcos, as he pressed
a spring. &#8220;This is the great seal of Joyalita, and it must
be used on all official documents. You will perceive that
it is in the form of a double-headed dragon, with the
letter &#8216;J&#8217; twisted about it like a rope.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick Carter bent over the watch and admired the ingenuity
with which the seal&mdash;almost as large around as
the watch case itself, but fitting just inside&mdash;would stand
forth when the spring was pressed, so that it could be
used on sealing wax.</p>

<p>He put the Seal of Gijon carefully in an inside waist-coat
pocket, and went away, after promising to come
back before he started on his long journey to Penza, in
Joyalita.</p>

<p>It was a quarter to nine that night when two taxicabs
arrived at the Grand Central Terminal in New York.
Five persons left the cabs and crossed the great concourse,
on their way to the express train ready to leave.</p>

<p>Three of the four men in the party carried hand baggage
of various descriptions. The fourth was wrapped
in a large overcoat, and only his eyes, nose, and mustache
could be easily distinguished between the two
points of the large upturned collar as he walked along.</p>

<p>He was conversing with a very pretty, dark-eyed girl,
expensively dressed and bearing all the marks of good
breeding so easily to be distinguished when present, and
quickly missed otherwise.</p>

<p>The man in the big overcoat was Nick Carter; the
young lady, Miss Claudia Solado, niece of the villainous
prime minister of Joyalita, Don Solado, and cousin of
Prince Marcos.</p>

<p>Claudia was a warm champion of her Cousin Marcos,
and her greatest regret was that Don Solado was the
brother of her dead father.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure you will get there safely, Mr. Carter,&#8221; she
was saying, as they crossed over to the train gate. &#8220;Poor
Marcos! He would be lost if it were not for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it,&#8221; laughed the detective. &#8220;So long as
he has such an earnest and faithful cousin as Miss
Claudia, he could not fail to win out at last. Will you
see me into the train, so that you can report to him?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>&#8220;Yes. If they will let me pass the gate,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to that,&#8221; returned the detective confidently.
&#8220;They will let you through.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they did. She walked up the platform to the Pullman
car by the side of him, talking in low, earnest tones
all the way.</p>

<p>Immediately behind came Chick, with a pointed beard,
dark spectacles, and carrying a black leather medical
case in his gloved hand. In his dark clothing and
high hat, he was the very picture of a well-to-do physician,
and, when he coughed a sonorous &#8220;Hem!&#8221; as he
passed the gate, was as impressive as Doctor Sloane
himself.</p>

<p>Patsy Garvan wore a light check suit and leather leggings,
with a cap of the same material as his suit. In his
pockets were a pair of handcuffs and the automatic revolver
which he always carried when out on business.</p>

<p>Incidentally, it may be said that both Nick Carter and
Chick were provided with similar useful implements.</p>

<p>The drawing-room which had been reserved for Mr.
Marcos and his physician, &#8220;Doctor Fordham,&#8221; was ready,
and Nick Carter and Chick went in at once, accompanied
by Claudia.</p>

<p>Patsy Garvan and Phillips were to ride in the Pullman
in ordinary seats, and they busied themselves in placing
the baggage that had not been stowed in the drawing-room.
Everything was done in the regulation manner,
and no one could doubt that the wealthy gentleman in the
drawing-room was all he appeared to be, with his two
servants in attendance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not seen anything of our friends the enemy,
have you, Miss Solado?&#8221; asked Nick, when they were
shut in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot be sure,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I did not see Miguel
or my uncle, Don Solado, anywhere about the station.
But I saw one face I thought I recognized&mdash;only I know
he is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jason, who used to be Marcos&#8217; undervalet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you saw his face?&#8221; asked Nick Carter
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw a face like his. But, as you know he is dead,
of course I must have been mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; agreed Nick. &#8220;Did you see what became
of this man who looks like Jason?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I missed him near the gate. He may be on this
train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s possible,&#8221; put in Chick. &#8220;It&#8217;s a long train, and
there might be a score of people on it whom we know
without our ever seeing one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could come with you, Mr. Carter,&#8221; said the
girl. &#8220;But my mother does not want to leave New York
just yet. She does not go out much, but she likes to
be near the bustle of this big city. It is just a notion,
but it is insistent, too. I do not care to leave her, although
she would not mind, for both she and I are used
to traveling alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be safer here, with your mother,&#8221; returned
the detective. &#8220;So long as I have Phillips to give me
a hint now and then, I shall be able to act the part of
your cousin satisfactorily, I am sure. Then, if I need
any other kind of help, I have my two assistants, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The cry of &#8220;All aboard!&#8221; came echoing along the platform
at this moment.</p>

<p>With a hasty &#8220;good-by, and thank you, Mr. Carter!&#8221;
Claudia Solado left the drawing-room and was helped
down to the platform by Chick.</p>

<p>In another minute the train was softly gliding away,
without noise or fuss, as the electric motor got to work.
Claudia was left on the platform watching the red tail
lights as they glimmered smaller and smaller, and finally
disappeared.</p>

<p>As she walked slowly from the station and entered the
taxicab which had been waiting for her, she did not perceive
a slim, ratlike-looking young man, hardly out of his
teens, who had been watching her, and who was close
behind her as she told the driver to take her to Crownledge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen the prince guy off,&#8221; muttered the young fellow.
&#8220;That is all I wanted to know. I&#8217;ll get up to the boss
and hand it to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a small, subdued-looking sort of hotel, in a side
street to which the spy made his way, and asked for Mr.
Miguel.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is, on the other side of the lobby,&#8221; replied
the clerk at the desk. &#8220;Do you know him when you
see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I know him,&#8221; was the reply, as the fellow slouched
over to Prince Miguel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Collins?&#8221; was Miguel&#8217;s greeting. &#8220;Did you see
Prince Marcos go away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;s gone, with three other fellows. One of
them was the man I&#8217;d seen before&mdash;his valet, Phillips. I
don&#8217;t know the other two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! How did the prince look? Was he sick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t seem so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you tell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. He was muffled up in a big overcoat, and you
could see only his nose and mustache.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mustache? Did he wear a mustache?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It was a little one, but I lamped it all right.
He walked along steadily, talking to the girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What girl? Who are you talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Solado. At least, that&#8217;s who you said she was,
when you was showing me the people I had to pick up
later. She was with this here prince, and she went into
the train with him. Afterward she came out, called a
taxi, and told the driver to take her to a place in upper
Broadway. She said she would show him the house she
wanted when she got there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Collins delivered all this information with the smoothness
of one accustomed to making detailed reports, and
Miguel knew he had heard all that his spy could tell
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite sure Prince Marcos was not seriously
hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet on that. He swung his arms as he walked,
and you could tell, from the move of him, that he felt
pretty good all around. I know how a guy acts when
he&#8217;s been plugged. There ain&#8217;t nothing wrong with this
prince, and you can bet on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do, Collins,&#8221; said Miguel, after a pause, during
which he finished the cigarette he had been smoking
and lighted another. &#8220;Be at your home, so that I can
call you up when I want you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be there right along as soon as I can get there.
It&#8217;s a regular hotel, even if it does look like a saloon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
and we have a telephone and everything to make a fellow
comfortable. So why shouldn&#8217;t I stay there?&#8221;</p>

<p>When Collins had gone, Prince Miguel got up, stretched
himself, and walked up and down the lobby, cigarette in
mouth, and deeply cogitating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Solado was right!&#8221; he muttered, between his teeth.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a sharp man, is Solado. He knew Marcos was too
badly shot to go to Penza just now. Yet a man supposed
to be Marcos has gone. I guess I&#8217;ll call up Marcos&#8217;
mother from Newport on the long distance, and tell her
Marcos has met with an accident. She&#8217;ll come rushing
up to Crownledge to see her son, and if he&#8217;s still there,
in bed, as I believe, why, I shall know what to wire to
Solado.&#8221;</p>

<p>He chuckled as he lighted another cigarette and strolled
over to the telephone desk to tell the operator to call
up Newport.</p>

<small>A PUZZLE FOR MIGUEL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>There was no train from Newport that night by the time
the Princess Laura Marcos, mother of the wounded prince,
got the telephone message from Miguel, and she did not
feel equal to motoring the distance at night.</p>

<p>By eleven o&#8217;clock the next morning, however, she stood
in the library at Crownledge, talking to Miguel. He had
met her at the station, and though he had not been a
welcome visitor at Crownledge heretofore, he had brought
her to her home now as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Claudia had met her Aunt Laura at the door, and had
said that she was staying at Crownledge to help take
care of the gentleman who had been hurt in the grounds
at Crownledge.</p>

<p>The princess had wondered why Claudia spoke of her
cousin in such a peculiar way. &#8220;The gentleman who has
been hurt&#8221; did not sound as if there were much cousinly
affection.</p>

<p>But, then, Claudia Solado had quarreled with Marcos
several times, and probably they had had a tiff now.
That would accent for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; murmured his mother to herself. &#8220;I never
knew two young people who liked each other who were
not always quarreling. That does not mean anything.
Still, considering the poor boy is sick&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Claudia had slipped out of the room, saying she wanted
to tell the trained nurse that her patient&#8217;s mother was
coming up.</p>

<p>The nurse had never been told the name of her patient.
She had heard him vaguely spoken of as &#8216;Marcos,&#8217; but
she had caught it as &#8216;Marsh.&#8217; Indeed, she had asked
Claudia, after the departure of Nick Carter, if that was
the name, to which the girl, inspired by a sudden idea,
had replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Claudia went into the bedchamber, and telling the nurse
that a lady had come to visit the patient, went to the
bed and bent over her cousin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marcos!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother is here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who sent for her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. But Miguel is downstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcus started up in bed, but, catching the reproving
eye of the nurse, he fell back again, and permitting that
cool-handed, nerveless person to rearrange the covers.
Then he turned to Claudia and whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare that scoundrel come into my home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find that out for you later. But listen to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When your mother comes in, don&#8217;t recognize her. You
are a Mr. Marsh, and you were coming to see Mr. Marcos,
who went out of town last night. Do you understand
all that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I do. Now that Miguel is here, I know
that all kinds of deceit has to be practiced to get the
better of him. Well, I&#8217;d do anything for the sake of my
beloved country. Better get that nurse out of the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gone. She won&#8217;t come back till after the interview.
I&#8217;ll take care of that,&#8221; the girl assured him.</p>

<p>Now that Claudia had attended to one side of the
affair, she had to look after the other. She must find
an opportunity to whisper a warning to her Aunt Laura.</p>

<p>She went back to the library and beckoned to her
aunt. Miguel was about to walk forward with the princess,
but something in Claudia&#8217;s eye warned her. So she
coolly stepped away from him and stood alone by a window,
with the girl.</p>

<p>The hint that they wanted to speak to each other
confidentially was too positive for Miguel to pretend to
misunderstand, although he would have given a great deal
to know what they intended to talk about.</p>

<p>So short was the conference, however, that he felt sure
nothing of importance had passed between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not recognize Marcos, aunt,&#8221; whispered Claudia.
&#8220;Beware of Miguel. I&#8217;ll tell you about it later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it in bed, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Marcos. But pretend you don&#8217;t know him. He
is supposed to be a Mr. Marsh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess Marcos, mother of the ruler of Joyalita,
did understand. She was an able, quick-thinking woman
of the world, and she had seen enough of diplomacy
and statesmanship to make her much more sophisticated
than the average woman of mere society.</p>

<p>Claudia led the way up the broad, old-fashioned staircase,
followed by Miguel and the princess.</p>

<p>Claudia softly opened the door of the bedchamber, and
stood aside to let her Aunt Laura enter.</p>

<p>Miguel followed the princess, and Claudia went in last,
closing the door after her.</p>

<p>The only occupants of the room were the three persons
who had just entered and the quiet figure in the
bed. He held a hand over his face, as if he could not
bear even the dim light of the chamber. A white bandage
was around his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, aunt!&#8221; whispered Claudia, in her ear. &#8220;Mr.
Marsh! You do not know him. Miguel would not believe
me, so I have not told him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The princess walked over to the bed, saying &#8220;Marcos!
My boy!&#8221; As she reached the bedside, she stopped in
well-simulated astonishment, and, looking around, asked:
&#8220;Why, Claudia, who is this gentleman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Mr. Marsh. He is a friend of Marcos&#8217;. Who
did you expect to see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it was Marcos,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marcos, aunt? Why, how could that be? Marcos
went to Joyalita yesterday. He was sorry to go, because
he would have liked to stay with Mr. Marsh. As it was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
he gave orders that Mr. Marsh should be carefully attended
until able to get up safely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry, sir,&#8221; said Marcos&#8217; mother, turning
again to the bed. &#8220;I thought it was my son. But I should
not possess natural humanity, if I did not sympathize very
heartily with you, even though I have never met you
before. I trust you will soon be restored to health.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, madam!&#8221; returned Marcos quietly.</p>

<p>She gave him a graceful bow and walked toward the
door, without even looking back.</p>

<p>What it cost her to do this only she knew. But she
had a part to play for the benefit of her beloved son,
even though she did not understand why, and she nerved
herself to go through it to the end.</p>

<p>As she went out, Miguel looked at the bed. Disheveled,
with the water-soaked bandage around his brow to allay
the fever and relieve his aching head, Marcos did not look
like himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound him! I can&#8217;t swear to him!&#8221; muttered
Miguel. &#8220;Did Marcos go to Joyalita? Did he, or didn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside the sick room the three walked down to the
library, where Prince Miguel bowed, and expressed his
sorrow to have brought the princess from Newport on
a misunderstanding. Then he walked out to his taxicab
and told the driver to speed downtown as fast as he
could.</p>

<p>When Miguel had gone, Laura turned to her aunt with
admiration and pleasure shining in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were splendid, aunt. If Miguel had ever found
out that this was really Marcos, he would have known
that the person representing him who has gone to Joyalita
could not be he. That would have meant all kinds
of trouble for Marcos and Joyalita, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>But before she had finished, the mother was upstairs
again, bending over her son and asking him what it all
meant.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />


<small>ON THE ROAD TO JOYALITA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Four days had passed since Nick Carter, in the character
of Prince Marcos, had glided out of the Grand
Central Terminal in New York City. He and his three
companions were traveling through a mountainous region
in Central America. The soft breath of the Caribbean
Sea tempered the tropical heat and made the atmosphere
ideal.</p>

<p>Nick had purchased a high-powered motor car before
leaving the United States. So when he found it desirable
to leave the lines of railroads and depend upon
the highways, he brought his car into use, and traveled
almost as fast&mdash;and much more comfortably&mdash;than he had
in his Pullman car.</p>

<p>Nick Carter drove and Patsy was by his side. As the
sun went down behind a range of rugged mountains in the
west, and the road became suddenly gloomy, Patsy looked
about curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! Where do we tear off our sleep to-night, chief?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t there some town on the map that we
can get to before pajama and nightie time? And supper?
What about that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not hungry, are you?&#8221; asked Nick, smiling behind his
mustache.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hungry?&#8221; ejaculated Patsy sarcastically. &#8220;Why, no,
chief! Whatever put that in your head? Didn&#8217;t I have
breakfast, at eight o&#8217;clock this morning, and didn&#8217;t I get
rye bread, fossilized beans, and boiled mud that they
called coffee? I had almost as much breakfast as I
would give to a three-year-old girl. The coffee&mdash;gee! that
coffee!&mdash;fixed me up right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see! What did we do about lunch?&#8221; asked Nick,
a merry twinkle still in his eye. &#8220;Did we have much
lunch?&#8221;</p>

<p>Patsy actually stood up in the car before he could
express his disgust. The occasion called for oratory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lunch!&#8221; he howled. &#8220;We had a puncture for lunch,
and we fed ourselves putting on a new tire and then
fixing a stripped gear. Altogether we were three hours
hung up on the road. When we got a start at last there
was no time to think of eating anything. Where do you
think we are now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About thirty miles from a little town I have been in
before,&#8221; was Nick Carter&#8217;s reply. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get supper and
bedrooms there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty miles? We ought to make that in half an
hour,&#8221; observed Patsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on these roads,&#8221; corrected Nick. &#8220;Sixty miles
an hour isn&#8217;t much when you&#8217;ve got a smooth surface.
But along this trail I guess twenty miles will be enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! That means an hour and a half!&#8221; grumbled
Patsy. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll chew on my left boot. It looks a little
softer than the other. Unless you&#8217;ll pull up a minute
or two and let me scoop up a handful of sand from the
side of the road. With some gasoline to wash it down,
that ought to go all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick Carter did not reply. He knew Patsy Garvan
too well to take any notice of his complaints. No doubt
the young man was hungry. But let any occasion arise
for him to become active, and he would forget his inner
wants at once. Having nothing else to do, he grumbled.</p>

<p>Chick laughed in the back of the car at Patsy&#8217;s comical
distress, but sympathized with him, nevertheless.</p>

<p>It was true, as Patsy had intimated, that they had had
nothing to eat since breakfast, and it certainly had been
an unsatisfactory meal.</p>

<p>They were passing through a region where the population
had too little work to do to keep them in health.
Like Patsy, they grumbled, in consequence. They cultivated
a little corn and a few beans, and lived on the
fruits that grew ready to their hands for the remainder.
But always they were dissatisfied.</p>

<p>Occasionally a wagon, drawn by mules, would make
a trip through these mountains. Then there would be
some few purchases, mostly of coffee and tobacco, the
money being wages received for farming for the few
comparatively wealthy men who had a score or so of
acres under cultivation and were too lazy to do the work
themselves.</p>

<p>If they had not needed coffee and tobacco, nobody
would have worked at all.</p>

<p>At a small farmhouse Nick and his party had stopped
for the night. The sight of real money had stimulated
the woman of the house, and she had actually given up
her own room and another to the four wayfarers.</p>

<p>There had been supper and breakfast after a sort, for
which Nick Carter had paid with a liberality that the
people considered only right for a royal personage.</p>

<p>They knew of Prince Marcos, they said&mdash;although this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
was not his country&mdash;and they had heard that he was
generous, as well as handsome.</p>

<p>When Nick Carter had paid them for the meals and
rooms, they were convinced that common report was
correct. The husband, wife, with four or five half-naked
children, all agreed that Prince Marcos was magnificently
free-handed.</p>

<p>&#8220;This next town is called Paron, and it is in Carita,
which adjoins Joyalita,&#8221; remarked Nick, in a general way,
to his companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carita is the little country that wants to swallow up
Joyalita, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Chick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered Phillips, the valet, who had been
silent heretofore, although taking a lively interest in the
conversation about him. &#8220;Representatives of Carita are
at Penza now. I hope we shall get there in time to
save Joyalita.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall do that, Phillips,&#8221; promised Nick Carter, without
looking around from the steering wheel. &#8220;We shall
roll into Penza some time in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t get there before noon, it will be too
late,&#8221; Phillips reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall not be late,&#8221; said Nick shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you can bet that when the chief says it that
way, it goes,&#8221; observed Patsy to himself.</p>

<p>Chick had discarded his high hat&mdash;which Phillips had
bestowed carefully in its own box&mdash;and now wore a soft
cap, which shaded his eyes. He had been staring out
to one side of the road, in silence, with his hand over
the visor of the cap, to make his vision better.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chief!&#8221; he whispered, leaning over the back of the
seat. &#8220;I think I saw him again just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Riding down the hill, on the other side of that thicket
of big trees. There seems to be a road over there where
horses can go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a trail of that kind,&#8221; answered Nick, steadily
driving. &#8220;It is not bad for horses, and it is much more
direct to Joyalita than this road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that is how this fellow keeps on cutting off
corners,&#8221; suggested Chick.</p>

<p>&#8220;It can easily be done,&#8221; assented Nick, still looking
straight ahead, in the light of the electric headlamps
which he had just turned on. &#8220;How many times have
we seen him now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since when?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night. He passed the house where we slept. We
saw him again while we were fixing up the tire and
gears, along the road, and now here he is again,&#8221; replied
Chick.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t mention the time when we saw the horse
standing, with his bridle trailing, in the valley, by the
side of a stream,&#8221; put in Patsy. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t see the man,
but he must have been there, all the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; agreed Nick. &#8220;Look at him through the
glass the next time we catch him in daylight. We ought
to have done that before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did do it,&#8221; announced Chick. &#8220;You were busy with
the car when we stopped about noon, and I took a good
long stare at him across the hood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well? What did he look like? Did you know
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never saw him before,&#8221; was Chick&#8217;s answer. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll
know him again. He is a dark fellow, with short hair.
He is in a linen suit of light gray, with a belt holding a
sword, and a large panama hat. There is a holster, with
a pistol in it, hanging to his belt, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Soldier?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. He hasn&#8217;t a uniform, and he doesn&#8217;t
carry himself stiff enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick Carter drove on, thinking, for ten minutes, before
he spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure you don&#8217;t recognize his face, Chick?&#8221; he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t see his face at that distance. I could only
make out his general appearance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you know his dress is gray?&#8221;</p>

<p>Chick looked uncomfortable for a moment. Then he
blurted out, half defiantly, as he leaned over the back of
the driving seat:</p>

<p>&#8220;If a man has on clothes that are not red, yellow, black,
or white, what can they be but gray?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick Carter smiled, and Patsy burst into a guffaw that
made Chick very indignant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Chick! You&#8217;re the cutest little guesser, when it
comes to colors, that ever moseyed down the pike. What
was the color of the lunch we had to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do, Patsy!&#8221; gently rebuked Nick Carter. &#8220;It
does not matter much whether the man&#8217;s clothes were
gray or any other color, so long as we block his game,
whatever it may be. Here&#8217;s the town of Paron that I
told you about, and right before us is the hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick drove the car into a courtyard and got out, glad
to stretch his limbs after his long drive. His three companions
were by his side as he looked about for some
place to take his car.</p>

<p>It was a rambling sort of shack that Nick had dignified
by the name of hotel, but quite evidently the landlord
took himself seriously.</p>

<p>He was a fat, greasy, long-haired individual, and he
spoke in broken English, or in Spanish, according to the
preference of his guests.</p>

<p>Nick Carter had been to this place before, but it was
several years previously, and the landlord did not remember
him.</p>

<p>This was just as well, since Nick had come now in
another character than his own, and he stood quietly
by, while Phillips informed the landlord that this was
his highness, Prince Marcos, of Joyalita, on his way to
Penza.</p>

<p>Phillips spoke Spanish, and instantly there was a
voluble conversation between the two, with the landlord
protesting that everything in this house, as well as in the
whole town, was at the disposal of Prince Marcos.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a liar, your highness,&#8221; whispered Phillips to Nick
Carter, as he drew a little aside. &#8220;His name is Mala. He
hates Joyalita and everybody in it. We must watch
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s cheerful information,&#8221; returned Nick. &#8220;I remember
seeing the fellow when I motored through here
a few years ago. But I had very little to do with him
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would be all right to an American coming through
in a car,&#8221; was Phillips&#8217; response. &#8220;It is the motor cars
that have made this village what it is. Many automobiles
pass along every week. Before that nothing was here.
Bicycles&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phillips referred to the useful &#8220;bike&#8221; in a contemptuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
tone. Evidently he regarded it as not worth any consideration.</p>

<p>Mala came forward, rubbing his hands, and asking, in
Spanish, if his highness would condescend to honor his
humble house till the morning, and what his highness
would be graciously pleased to like for supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place, Mala,&#8221; broke in Phillips sternly,
&#8220;you know that in Joyalita the speech is English&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Yes!&#8221; interrupted Mala, with an apologetic upward
sweep of his palms. &#8220;I am stupid. I am a mule.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A jackass, I should say,&#8221; remarked Patsy, in an inaudible
tone. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like that guy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the next place,&#8221; went on Phillips, disregarding all
interruptions, &#8220;you will set forth the best of everything
you have, with some good wine in a sealed bottle. Understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will open the wine for his highness,&#8221; protested Mala.
&#8220;He must not have the trouble&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do nothing of the kind,&#8221; snapped Phillips. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
open the bottle. Bring it sealed, or I will not take it from
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mala shrugged his shoulders, and pointed to a large
open room, in which three lamps, illuminated with American
kerosene, were burning. The room had several fairly
comfortable chairs, including two rockers and a sofa, with
a large mahogany table in the center. It was a curious
combination of American civilization and mountain
savagery.</p>

<p>Nick Carter saw that Chick and Patsy were looking
after the car, putting it under the cover of a tumble-down
old shack.</p>

<p>Then he turned toward the room into which the bowing
Mala was anxious to usher him.</p>

<p>Nick sat down near a wide-open window, which commanded
the road, while Mala went to look after the
preparations for supper and to get the sealed bottle of
wine for which Phillips had so urgently stipulated.</p>

<p>For five minutes Nick Carter reclined in one of the two
comfortable American rockers, his hand before his face,
but his eyes peering out between the fingers.</p>

<p>Suddenly he jumped from the chair, ran out of the
front door, and crossed the dusty road.</p>

<p>Behind a huge bowlder, one of several which had rolled
down from the mountains at different periods, he came
across a man, who had been peeping out slyly, watching
the detective in the hotel room.</p>

<p>He wore a panama hat and he had a ridiculous sword
in his belt.</p>

<p>Nick Carter seized this man by the throat in so strong
a grip that he could only gurgle incoherently, as he struggled
vainly to escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you didn&#8217;t die, after all!&#8221; said Nick, with a grim
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Die? Of course not. Who do you think I am?&#8221; demanded
the man, as the detective slightly released his
grip to allow the words to come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who do I <i>think</i> you are, my friend?&#8221; rejoined Nick
Carter. &#8220;I <i>know</i> who you are, in spite of the mustache
you have stuck on your lip to deceive me. You are
Jason, the rascal who was in the employ of Prince Marcos,
now trying to get back to his own country in time
to save it from ruin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is not Jason, and I don&#8217;t know what you are
talking about,&#8221; was the surly response. &#8220;I never heard of
Prince Marcos. Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Nick could say anything more, the fellow, realizing
that the hold upon him was not so strong as it had
been, made a sudden dive and got away.</p>

<p>A mocking laugh came back to the detective. But it
was too dark to pursue the man, and Nick went back to
the hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as if I shall have some little work to do
before I land in Penza to put my veto on that annexation
resolution in the name of Prince Marcos,&#8221; he murmured,
as he lighted a cigar.</p>

<small>A ONE-EYED BEAUTY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Nothing occurred to disturb the supper which Nick Carter
and his two assistants enjoyed later.</p>

<p>Phillips oscillated between the dining room and the
kitchen regions, bringing the dishes himself.</p>

<p>He would not trust any one else to do this work, and
Nick Carter learned afterward that he had superintended
the preparation of all the viands, besides being careful
that the quart bottle of red wine served had never been
tampered with since its importation from Spain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phillips thinks they are going to dope us, I reckon,&#8221;
observed Patsy, in a whisper, to Chick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they did try something
like that,&#8221; was Chick&#8217;s answer. &#8220;I suppose you know that
Jason was around here to-night, and that he isn&#8217;t alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! Is that so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does the chief know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But he can&#8217;t show that he knows it. You must
not forget that he is Prince Marcos, and princes leave
the guarding of their royal persons to their followers,&#8221;
replied Chick solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right!&#8221; observed Patsy. &#8220;We can guard this
prince. I&#8217;d just like to see this Jason start something.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bedrooms to which they were shown were on the
upper floor. There were three of them, all opening out
on a narrow and rather stuffy hall.</p>

<p>Nick Carter, as the guest of honor, in the person of
Prince Marcos, was assigned to the room overlooking the
dusty road. In the next apartment, which communicated
with his own, were bestowed Chick and Patsy. They had
separate narrow beds that never were made for a person
to run around in.</p>

<p>Phillips was in a smaller chamber at the back.</p>

<p>The door of Nick Carter&#8217;s room leading to the hall
was locked, and a bolt inside was secured. His window
had iron bars across it.</p>

<p>There had been a great many brigands in the mountains
in times gone by, and it was not considered wise to
leave any house unprotected by bars at the windows and
strong fastenings on the doors.</p>

<p>This hotel had at one time been the home of a
wealthy miner, when gold and platinum had been plentiful
in the neighboring mountains.</p>

<p>The valuable ore had gradually been dug out till there
was no more in sight, and when the owner of the mines
died, the industry died with him.</p>

<p>His home had been empty for several years, and then
Mala, seeing that the rush of motor cars gave promise
of a paying trade for a hotel, took the house, and had
found it fairly profitable for a person of his lazy habits.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>Nick Carter was tired from driving the car all day, and
he slept soundly during the first few hours of the night.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark when he awoke with a start. He had
the curious, indescribable feeling that a stranger was in
the room.</p>

<p>Softly he stretched out his hand, to get hold of the
automatic pistol in the pocket of his coat that hung on
a chair at his bedside.</p>

<p>Instead of getting to his pocket, his hand fell into
the grasp of a large hand, with thick fingers, which
closed tightly about his own. At the same moment a
pillow was pressed against his face, and several men&mdash;he
could not tell how many&mdash;lifted him from his bed.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken, but it seemed as if the men
all knew exactly what they were to do. They carried
him noiselessly in the darkness till he felt the cool air of
early morning blowing upon him.</p>

<p>He did not yield without a struggle. But there seemed
to be so many men that he could not release himself,
and continually there was the pressure of the pillow upon
his face so that he could hardly breathe.</p>

<p>Down the stairs and out to the open he was carried.
The increasing coolness told him he was clear of the
house.</p>

<p>He had on only his pajamas, and when he was placed
in a motor car, he wondered whether his clothes had
been left behind.</p>

<p>Somebody loosened the pillow from his face, so that
he could get his breath a little more freely, but it was
still kept in place by a rope fastened around his neck. A
pair of slippers much too large for him were slipped on
his feet.</p>

<p>By this time the car was moving at a fast clip, and
from the way it bumped at intervals, he knew he was
not on the road by which he had come to this little village,
but was hustling along a rough trail, that never
had been laid out for motoring.</p>

<p>Nick Carter&#8217;s thoughts were busy as he rushed through
the air. But he possessed the great gift of patience, and
since he knew he could not help himself at present, he
was content to await developments.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had on my clothes, and that I knew whether
they have taken my pistol,&#8221; he muttered behind the pillow.
&#8220;There is one comfort. I am pretty sure who the
rascals are that are doing this. How was it they did
not disturb Patsy or Chick?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was soon able to answer this question for himself,
as he reflected on the incidents immediately preceding
their going up to bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t drink any of that fellow Mala&#8217;s coffee. The
other three did. Phillips was watching everything in the
kitchen. But it does not take long to slip a few drops of
a narcotic into a coffeepot, or even to mix in some powders
of the same kind. I guess that was it. Perhaps I am
wrong, but I can&#8217;t account for their sleeping through it
all in any other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He estimated that he had been traveling for more than
an hour, when the car slowed down easily and came to a
standstill.</p>

<p>Hardly had it stopped when he was lifted out of the
car, the pillow still over his face, and led up a steep path
which he found was plentifully strewn with bowlders.</p>

<p>There were so many hands on him, and he could hear
the tramping of so many feet, that he judged it would
be well to wait a little longer before making the fight
for liberty that was in his mind from the first.</p>

<p>When he stopped walking, which was not till he had
climbed the rough path for ten or fifteen minutes, he
felt a difference in the atmosphere. The breeze ceased, and
a dampness crept through him.</p>

<p>The pillow was whisked off, and he put his hands to his
eyes in the endeavor to see what was around him.</p>

<p>He was in a cave, lighted only by the daylight that
found its way in by a tunnellike entry, and six men stood
around.</p>

<p>With the exception of one, whom he knew at once to
be his old acquaintance, Jason, they were strangers to
him. A second glance told him they were of the brigand
type which is by no means uncommon in the wilder parts
of Central and South America.</p>

<p>They were roughly dressed, with lightweight calico
shirts, high-laced boots, and broad-brimmed hats, which
slouched over their evil faces.</p>

<p>Each man had a belt with cartridges and pistol, and
there was a rifle in the hands of the individual who seemed
to be in command.</p>

<p>This gentleman, who had a long black mustache and a
heavy beard of the same hue, and whose beauty had
been interfered with by the loss of an eye, glared at Nick
Carter sideways through the eye he had still, and grunted,
in Spanish:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prince Marcos,&#8221; replied Nick Carter composedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that right, se&ntilde;or?&#8221; asked the one-eyed chieftain,
swinging around to Jason.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is. But the people of Joyalita are not pleased with
him. They want him to be punished.&#8221;</p>

<p>This evidently struck all the rascals as a joke, for they
joined in a raucous chorus of mirth which made Nick
itch to pass around and give each one a hearty raise
with his foot.</p>

<p>Only the fact that he had nothing on his feet but the
pair of old slippers that probably belonged to Mala made
him doubt the desirability of such a proceeding.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the order of Prince Miguel&mdash;who, at the council
to-morrow, will be chosen by the people to rule them&mdash;that
Prince Marcos shall remain in the mountains with
you until he sends for him,&#8221; continued Jason.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! It shall be done,&#8221; grunted the chieftain. &#8220;Prince
Miguel is my friend. Tell him he has the word of
Gaspara.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man slapped himself on his broad chest as he
uttered this last name, and Nick would have known from
that action, if nothing else, that he was the Gaspara
referred to.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not let him escape?&#8221; asked Jason, as a sly
expression of cunning passed over his humid countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gaspara&#8217;s prisoners never escape,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will go,&#8221; went on Jason. &#8220;I have to report to
his highness that you will do what he asks. The clothes
of the prisoner are in the car. Will you send one of your
men with me to bring them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaspara motioned to a man who had been standing in
the background with two others, and the fellow followed
Jason out of the cave.</p>

<p>Nick Carter had been counting the men, and he had
found that, including Gaspara&mdash;whom his men addressed
as <i>El Capitaine</i>&mdash;there were eight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>The detective had heard of the Gaspara band of mountain
robbers, who infested this part of the country, but
never had come across them before.</p>

<p>They had attacked American tourists more than once,
and thrilling tales of the threats made by the rascals
if ransom were not paid had reached New York from
time to time.</p>

<p>The detective had taken all these reports with the
traditional grain of salt, and had allowed amply for the
terror of those who had been captured.</p>

<p>Now that he had come face to face with Gaspara, and
had noted his cruel, relentless face, made more hideous
by the loss of an eye, he gave more credit to what he
had heard about this fellow and his band.</p>

<p>Nick Carter was still reflecting on the crimes he had
heard attributed to the Gaspara outfit, when the man who
had gone to the car with Jason came back, carrying his
clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put them on!&#8221; commanded Gaspara.</p>

<p>The scoundrel spoke in Spanish, taking it for granted
that Nick understood, since he was supposed to be Prince
Marcos, who lived in a part-Spanish community.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Nick had perfect command of that
tongue&mdash;as he had of eight or ten others&mdash;and he picked
up his clothes without a moment of hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will feel good to have a proper pair of soles under
my feet, if nothing else,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;These flopping
slippers are a nuisance.&#8221;</p>

<p>In about five minutes he was attired in the habiliments
which were supposed to be those of Prince Marcos, including
the comfortable motoring cap that was part of
the outfit.</p>

<p>Mechanically he put his hands into his coat pockets.</p>

<p>To his joy, and rather surprised, he felt his automatic
pistol in one pocket and his silver-plated handcuffs in
the other, together with his handkerchief, gloves, and
other little things he had carried there before he was
made a prisoner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange they didn&#8217;t rob me,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;But, after
all, that is not their object, I suppose. What they want
is to keep me out of Penza till Prince Miguel and Don
Solado, with the remainder of the blackguardly plotters,
have signed that paper which gives Joyalita partly to the
neighboring country of Carita, and partly to Prince Miguel.
It looks as if they would succeed in that, too,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;unless I find some way to circumvent my friend here
with the odd eye and the tarred-rope mustache.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps Gaspara surmised that the detective was making
uncomplimentary comments on his personal appearance.</p>

<p>He stepped in front of his prisoner, and, transfixing
him horribly with his solitary optic, poured out a volume
of spluttering Spanish, interspersed with oaths in that language,
which Nick would have had difficulty in following
had he not been so familiar with the tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, my prince!&#8221; snarled Gaspara. &#8220;I shall not
put ropes on you, or shut you up anywhere. I have no
prisons, and I can&#8217;t spare cords to tie you. But if you
walk out of this cave, you will be met at the outside
by two of my men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; queried Nick, as he paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very well,&#8221; grinned the brigand, showing two
rows of white teeth in doing so. &#8220;They will cut off your
ears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pleasant!&#8221; remarked Nick, aloud&mdash;without meaning to
do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;The second time you do it, they will kill you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be no second time,&#8221; declared Nick Carter.</p>

<p>Gaspara looked at him as if he did not quite understand
what this meant. Then he shrugged his shoulders
and stalked heavily away.</p>

<p>He was brought back in a hurry by an involuntary
exclamation of dismay from the detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only wanted to ask whether I am to get any breakfast,&#8221;
replied Nick.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have it as soon as the coffee is made,&#8221; promised
Gaspara, as again he moved toward the entrance of
the cave.</p>

<p>Nick Carter did want his breakfast. But that was
not why he had given vent to his sharp ejaculation.</p>

<p>He had just felt in a certain inside pocket, and missed
therefrom an article which was worth more than everything
else he carried with him.</p>

<p>The Seal of Gijon had been stolen!</p>

<small>WHEN THEY WOKE UP.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was just about the time that Nick Carter discovered
the loss of the diamond-incrusted watch and fob which
were known collectively as the Seal of Gijon, when Patsy
awoke from a sound sleep in Mala&#8217;s hotel and groaned:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! How my head aches! And my mouth tastes
like the New York subway smells.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked across to where Chick was stirring in his
narrow bed, and tried to remember where he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; responded Chick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What time is it?&#8221; came the drowsy response.</p>

<p>Patsy did not answer. He was gradually getting his
thoughts together, and he determined that this was not like
Chick&#8217;s ordinary demeanor in the morning, no matter
how late he might have retired the night before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not Chick&#8217;s real voice that responded, but a
muffled echo of his usual incisive tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s biting him?&#8221; muttered Patsy. &#8220;Is he going
nutty?&#8221;</p>

<p>Patsy Garvan hoisted himself out of bed, and when his
head had ceased swimming&mdash;at least to some extent&mdash;he
walked over to Chick and gave his shoulder a rude
yank.</p>

<p>Chick sat up, rubbing his eyes and pressing his two
hands to the back of his head alternately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sick?&#8221; asked Patsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel pretty raw this morning,&#8221; replied Chick, shaking
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Raw?&#8221; echoed Patsy. &#8220;I feel as if it would take a
week&#8217;s cooking to make me fit for the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it all about?&#8221; mumbled Chick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something has slipped a cog and put a kink in our
differential,&#8221; answered Patsy. &#8220;We are not in New York,
old man. This is the country of the Caribbean Sea,
and all the goodness has been drained out of it by the
Panama Canal. Get up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221;</p>

<p>Chick rolled out and stretched his arms, while Patsy
softly opened the door of Nick Carter&#8217;s room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>&#8220;Hello! The chief is up!&#8221; exclaimed Patsy. &#8220;Wonder
he didn&#8217;t call us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the door into the hall&mdash;only to meet Phillips,
who had his hand up to knock. He looked heavy and
disgruntled, like the other two.</p>

<p>Before Patsy could speak, the valet pushed him gently
back into the room and shut the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;We should not have drunk that coffee,&#8221; began Phillips.
&#8220;Let me see how the prince is.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked into Nick Carter&#8217;s bedroom and started as he
saw that he was not there. Then he slipped over to the
bed and examined it carefully about half a minute.</p>

<p>With a low exclamation he picked up from the bed-clothing
a small meerschaum cigarette holder and took
it over to the window to look at it closer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you got there?&#8221; asked Chick.</p>

<p>Phillips put the article into Chick&#8217;s hand and shrugged
his shoulders. Chick passed the holder to Patsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose is it?&#8221; asked Patsy. &#8220;It&#8217;s an old-timer, all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jason!&#8221;</p>

<p>Phillips dropped this name from his lips as if it explained
everything that needed to be known. Then he
turned to the bed. It showed plainly that it had been
slept in, but it was tumbled in such a manner as to suggest
that its occupant had got up in a hurry.</p>

<p>Chick also gazed at the bed, while the habit of deduction,
which had been emphasized in him by the admonitions
of Nick Carter, caused him to note every little detail,
no matter how unimportant it might appear to be
at first glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many pillows were there on this bed last night,
Phillips?&#8221; he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite sure, doctor,&#8221; replied Phillips, who never forgot
that Chick was supposed to be a Doctor Fordham on this
trip.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of them is missing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phillips looked about the room, under the bed, behind
the shabby dresser, and in out-of-the-way corners. Then
he gazed steadily at Chick and nodded his head as if he
had come to an indubitable conclusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jason must have taken it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He has been
near us for a day. Prince Marcos caught him last night,
opposite the hotel, but Jason got away. I will go and see
about the motor car. Will you have breakfast first?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Breakfast nothing!&#8221; snapped Patsy. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t dare
to take anything here again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have made some coffee that I know is right,&#8221; was
Phillips&#8217; quiet announcement. &#8220;I was sick, and I went
downstairs to get some water from the well. Then I felt
better, and, as there was no one else in the kitchen, I
made some coffee on the fire and brought it up in a
pitcher. See.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the two detectives into his own room, and showed
them a pitcher of hot coffee, with two of the heavy white-stone
mugs used in that region, some thick slices of rye
bread, a goodly sized cube of butter, and a table knife.</p>

<p>Patsy chuckled as he put his face above the pitcher
of coffee and allowed the grateful aroma to steam up into
his nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a dandy, Phil!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;There&#8217;s even
a paper of sugar and cream in the coffee. Here&#8217;s &#8216;how,&#8217;
fellows!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an axiom with Patsy Garvan that a good thing
should be grabbed quickly wherever it was found. So
he poured out half a mug of the coffee, stirred in some
sugar with the handle of the knife, and threw it down his
throat with a jerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have some, Chick?&#8221;</p>

<p>Patsy acted as host to his comrade, while Phillips gazed
at them with stony complacency and waited for them to
say something about their missing chief.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that either Chick or Patsy
had for a moment lost sight of the fact that the disappearance
of Nick Carter proved that the enemies of
Prince Marcos were close on their trail.</p>

<p>They drank their coffee and disposed of some of the
bread and butter, because they knew they could not do
effective work unless they kept up their strength.</p>

<p>But their discussion of the case went on between mouthfuls,
and with such effect that they were ready to start
in pursuit of the men who had spirited away their leader
even before they had finished breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phillips says our motor car is still in the shed, where
it was put last night,&#8221; observed Chick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard him,&#8221; answered Patsy, from the depths of his
coffee mug. &#8220;He says it is dirtier than when we came
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Been used in the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must have had dust on it when we got here,&#8221; suggested
Patsy. &#8220;The road we covered wasn&#8217;t any polished
hard-wood floor, Chick. Don&#8217;t forget that, old man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. We had dust on everything when we rolled
into the yard below. Only it happens that Phillips wiped
it all off with cloths, a wet sponge, and chamois polisher,&#8221;
returned Chick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; put in Phillips respectfully. &#8220;I knew the car
would not run well if it were not cleaned. Besides, we
expect to run into Penza to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean, we <i>did</i> expect to do it,&#8221; remarked Patsy
significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall do so,&#8221; said Chick, with a reproachful glance
at his friend. &#8220;Unless you don&#8217;t feel inclined to go
after the chief and bring him back in spite of anything
and anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>Patsy&#8217;s face worked convulsively and his eyes blazed.
For a moment he was inclined to let fly at his fellow
worker, much as he liked him.</p>

<p>He controlled himself, but the tones in which, the next
instant, he addressed Chick, were as sharp and cold as
zero-made icicles.</p>

<p>&#8220;If anybody in the world except you or the chief had
handed that to me, Chick,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;d have had to tear
into him if I knew I was going to be licked to a standstill
in the first round.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, Patsy!&#8221; interrupted Chick. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To think that you, Chickering Carter, would ever say
that to me,&#8221; went on Patsy, his voice trembling. &#8220;Have
I ever held back? Don&#8217;t you think I care as much about
the chief as anybody? Why, I&#8217;d buck a charge of the
Light Brigade for him, and chew up a thirteen-inch gun
afterward, just to prove that I was with him first, last,
and all the time. Gee! Chick! You&#8217;ve hurt me where
I live! I&#8217;m sore, and I can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It did not take Chick more than thirty seconds to
placate Patsy, but that was only because there was no
time to be wasted in sentimentality. If there had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
plenty of leisure, Patsy would have had to be coaxed
and apologized to for half an hour.</p>

<p>That anybody should intimate, ever so indirectly, that he
was not loyal to Nick Carter to the backbone, was something
Patsy could not stand. When he said he was &#8220;sore,&#8221;
he told only the truth. His feelings were rasped worse
than they had been for many a long day.</p>

<p>So taken up had Patsy been with the injustice of Chick&#8217;s
remarks that he had almost lost sight of the work before
him. He was brought to himself by the sudden reappearance
in the room of Phillips.</p>

<p>&#8220;The motor car is ready, sir,&#8221; announced Phillips, in the
same well-modulated tone in which he would have said
&#8220;Dinner is served, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went downstairs, without seeing anybody about the
place. Mala was not visible, and he had no assistants
except his wife, who was hidden in the scullery most of
the time.</p>

<p>Chick spent about ten minutes in the dusty roadway before
he climbed into the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way are we going, Chick?&#8221; asked Patsy, as he
took his place by the side of his comrade, who was in the
driver&#8217;s seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;The marks of our wheels show that the car came down
the side road leading over the mountains,&#8221; ventured
Phillips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; returned Chick. &#8220;I have been looking
things over. We have a patch on one of our hind
tires, and it shows quite plainly in the dust. Jump in.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Phillips had taken his seat in the back of the machine,
Chick turned into the side road&mdash;which ran up a
rather steep hill&mdash;and opened the throttle wider.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see old Mala peeping out of a lower window at the
corner of a blind,&#8221; observed Patsy. &#8220;The old rip thinks
we don&#8217;t get on to him. Gee! I&#8217;d like to make over
his ugly face!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jason is by his side,&#8221; put in Phillips, with his usual
coolness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to Jason the next time I meet him,&#8221; called
out Chick, over his shoulder. &#8220;Where will this road take
us, Phillips?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anywhere,&#8221; was the rather unsatisfying answer. &#8220;It depends
on how far you go.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br />


<small>THE TRAIL TO THE CAVE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The sun was well up, and the whole rugged landscape
began to seethe under its direct, unshadowed rays, when
Chick, after an hour&#8217;s run, suddenly stopped the car.</p>

<p>They had been making good time, even though it was
mostly uphill.</p>

<p>All three occupants developed caution now, as they
felt instinctively that they were entering a zone of danger.</p>

<p>Chick had been thinking steadily&mdash;while he guided the
big car with the instinctive skill of a good driver&mdash;and he
had come to the conclusion that his chief had been inveigled
into the depths of this desolate country, to keep
him away till it would be too late for Marcos to save his
beloved Joyalita.</p>

<p>Once Chick had talked over his shoulder to Phillips for
several minutes. The result of that conversation had enabled
him to lay out a plan which might or might not be
successful, but which, at all events, would be something
definite to work on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gaspara!&#8221; had been Phillips&#8217; reply to his question as
to whether there were any notorious bad men in these
mountains.</p>

<p>Further questioning had brought out that Gaspara was
the leader of a gang of brigands, consisting of eight or
nine rascals who had come together when they all worked
on the construction of the Panama Canal, and who had
decided that they could make more money, as well as enjoy
the freedom they liked by infesting the automobile
highways up and down the Caribbean coast.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have their headquarters somewhere in the mountains,&#8221;
explained Phillips. &#8220;But they go a long way when
they hear of any party of tourists that they think they can
pick up, or some wagons with valuable freight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the kind of men,&#8221; was Chick&#8217;s response. &#8220;Have
they horses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes. They use mules and automobiles, too. All
stolen. When they want a horse or motor car, they just
go somewhere and pick it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Free and easy, eh?&#8221; put in Patsy. &#8220;They&#8217;re the real
&#8216;I-should-worry&#8217; citizens. The only thing against it, I
should think, is that they&#8217;ll be shot or hanged at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Chick stopped he was on a narrow plateau at the
top of a long hill up which he had been climbing for fifteen
minutes. Just ahead of him was a curve and then another
hill.</p>

<p>He ran the car under the shelter of the overhanging
rocks, and moved to the edge of the flat surface to see
what was beyond.</p>

<p>He had to walk about a hundred feet. Then he drew
back instinctively. He was on the edge of a sheer descent
of about five hundred feet. The road broke off as
sharply as if it had been cut down with a gigantic cheese
knife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad place to drive a car, Chick!&#8221; observed Patsy, who
had come along behind him. &#8220;I&#8217;d keep well in against the
wall, if I were you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I have done, Patsy,&#8221; was the short reply.
&#8220;See that your gun is all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; answered Patsy. &#8220;But, why
the reminder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>

<p>Chick had dropped to one knee behind one of the huge
bowlders that were thickly strewn about, and Patsy, taking
the hint, dropped also, as he followed the direction
of his comrade&#8217;s pointing finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see anything but a steep hill and something
black at the top,&#8221; declared Patsy.</p>

<p>Chick drew from a pocket the powerful field glass belonging
to the motor car, and which he had taken out of
its case when he left the machine.</p>

<p>Through the glass he took a long survey of the hill
and what Patsy had called &#8220;something black.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I wasn&#8217;t mistaken,&#8221; observed Chick, taking
the glass from his eyes. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t need the glass. That
black something is the opening of a cave. Outside it you
can see, with the glass, there is a fire burning. The smoke
stretches across the sky for miles, I should think. You
see, the wind is blowing away from us, or the smoke would
blow right over our heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have to curve right around this deep valley
to get there,&#8221; muttered Patsy. &#8220;But I reckon that&#8217;s where
we&#8217;re likely to find the chief. Let&#8217;s ask Phillips if he
knows what&#8217;s in that cave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phillips was asked, but he could not say positively. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
knew that Gaspara and his gang often took up their habitation
in caves in the mountains. But they were a migratory
lot, and seldom could be found in one place longer
than a few weeks at a time&mdash;often only a few days.</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble is they may see the automobile when we
get near,&#8221; mused Chick. &#8220;Still, I think we can go almost
to the bottom of their hill without showing ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all got into the car, and Chick saw that he would
be sheltered from the view of people at the mouth of the
cave until he would be near enough to leave the car and
pursue the rest of the way on foot.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind that he would find Nick Carter
there. Every sign pointed to the likelihood of Gaspara
having taken up his quarters on that hill, and knowing that
he was willing to undertake any job if paid enough for
it, there seemed no reasonable doubt that he had consented
to help out the plotters of Joyalita by holding prisoner
the supposed Prince Marcos.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where we shall have to get out,&#8221; said Chick, as
he pulled the machine to the side of the road. &#8220;The hill
begins just around that bend and winds up over our
heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an overhanging shelf of rock which made
a safe place for the car. On either side of it, the hill ran
down straight from above, breaking off precipitously some
ten yards at the other side of the roadway.</p>

<p>The drop here was only about fifty feet, but that would
be quite enough to jolt anybody who might happen to fall
over, as Patsy sagely remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the game now?&#8221; he asked, looking at Chick.</p>

<p>&#8220;To get up that hill under cover as well as we can,
and rush the cave,&#8221; returned Chick coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think they are all in there?&#8221; asked Patsy, just
as calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I have seen six of them go out and move up
the hill at the back of the cave. Suppose that there are
nine in the gang, we shall have to meet only three. If
the number is eight, it will be two. We can depend on
the chief to help when we get the ropes off him. I suppose
they have him bound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; assented Patsy. &#8220;I guess there ain&#8217;t much
doubt that we shall find him there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None at all,&#8221; rejoined Chick. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you been watching
the trail?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;ve seen that patch on the hind tire marked in
the mud once in a while. But there has been so much
bare stone to go over, where no tracks show, that I have
got mixed up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; declared Chick quietly. &#8220;I saw the patch a
few yards back, and there is another in the road right
ahead of us. We shall have so easy a time picking up
that trail that it would be a disgrace if we lost it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They followed the trail to the foot of the winding hill.
Then they halted, and Chick told Phillips to remain where
he was while they went up to find out what might be in
the cave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be better for Phillips to get to the car and
have it all ready to make a jump when we get there?&#8221;
suggested Patsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; agreed Chick. &#8220;Do that, Phillips.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, Doctor Fordham,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor Fordham?&#8221; exclaimed Patsy, mystified for a moment.
&#8220;Oh, yes. I&#8217;d forgotten your name, doctor,&#8221; he
added, with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget it when there happen to be strangers
around, Patsy,&#8221; warned Chick, as he began to ascend the
hill&mdash;bent over, to make himself as inconspicuous as possible.</p>

<p>They had gone about halfway up the hill, to where there
was a sharp turn, when a shower of rocks came whirling
down, bouncing from one side to the other, and compelling
Chick and Patsy to skip about nimbly to avoid them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the blazes?&#8221; blurted out Patsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep quiet!&#8221; came from Chick.</p>

<p>More rocks, none of them very big, but so plentiful that
it was impossible to dodge them all. Then, hatless and
with hair flying, there shot around the corner&mdash;Nick
Carter!</p>

<p>&#8220;Run, boys!&#8221; he called out, rather breathlessly. &#8220;They&#8217;re
coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many?&#8221; inquired Patsy, as he ran to the side of
his chief and kept step with him going down the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! That&#8217;s easy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Patsy stopped short and leveled his revolver at the jutting
rock around which he expected to see a man coming.</p>

<p>He was not disappointed. One of Gaspara&#8217;s gang stumbled
into view. He had hardly done so when there came
two cracks from Patsy&#8217;s revolver, and the man pitched on
his face and rolled over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought I&#8217;d get him,&#8221; observed Patsy contentedly. &#8220;Are
there any more, chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two followed me,&#8221; answered Nick Carter. &#8220;But keep
on. You have the motor car, I suppose, Chick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right! Then we can get away. Have you seen
that fellow Jason?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But we&#8217;ve found tracks of him,&#8221; answered Patsy.</p>

<p>The three were running at top speed, talking jerkily as
they moved along.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s those other two men?&#8221; asked Patsy, glancing
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>No other man had come into view since the fall of the
one shot by Patsy. They had evidently feared a dangerous
ambush.</p>

<p>Even if they were bandits, they had some respect for
their lives.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are holding back,&#8221; observed Chick. &#8220;But there
are more than three, aren&#8217;t there, chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Six more. But they went out an hour ago. I
have been watching a chance to make a rush ever since.
The moment seemed to come at last, and I made a bolt
for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully!&#8221; broke out Patsy, in uncontrollable admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they shoot at you?&#8221; asked Chick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t give them a chance,&#8221; was Nick&#8217;s reply. &#8220;I
knocked two of them down, with right and left-handers,
and the third was stooping over the fire, with his back
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have given a year&#8217;s pay to see it,&#8221; declared Patsy
enthusiastically. &#8220;There&#8217;s the car!&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, the motor car was ready to start, under the
sheltering rock. The ever-watchful Phillips stood at the
side, with both doors open, ready to close them with a
snap as soon as the three detectives were in their
places.</p>

<p>Phillips never allowed himself to betray surprise. So
he took the coming of Nick Carter quite as a matter of
course, and never even raised his respectable, well-trained
eyebrows as Nick jumped in and took the wheel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>The next moment Phillips was sitting by the side of
Patsy, while Chick was at Nick&#8217;s right hand, and the car
began to surge along the narrow pathway, with the throttle
well open.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br />


<small>A RACE WITH A ROCK.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The car that Nick Carter drove was good for a mile
a minute on any sort of road. He did not push it to
anything like that speed now, with a yawning precipice
only a few yards away from him on one side, and numbers
of stones, gaps, and rough places under the wheels.</p>

<p>He moved at a good, comfortable pace, however, for he
knew that the six bandits who had left the cave could
not be far away, and that they would start in pursuit as
soon as Gaspara knew what had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gaspara was away when you got out, I suppose?&#8221; asked
Chick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. If he had been there, it would not have been
possible to escape at all, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get him later, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it seems worth while,&#8221; replied Nick, letting out an
extra link on the speed of the automobile.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make the little town of Paron, where Mala is, in
about an hour, even at this speed,&#8221; observed Patsy, settling
back comfortably in his seat. &#8220;Shall we have time to give
Mala his, chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not expect to have leisure for Mala,&#8221; returned
Nick Carter. &#8220;My business now is to get to Penza in as
short a time as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This piece of road we are reaching now is in full view
of the hill where the cave is,&#8221; observed Chick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see it is. We&#8217;ll go through in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick Carter opened the throttle still wider, and the great
machine leaped forward like a mettlesome horse that had
been spurred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! We&#8217;re in the open now, for fair!&#8221; shouted
Patsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the rest of the gang up there,&#8221; added Chick.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are getting ready to shoot,&#8221; remarked Phillips.</p>

<p>They could hear the distant crack of rifle shots, and
they could make out the heads of the bandits as they lay
behind a ridge and took as careful aim at the automobile
as they could.</p>

<p>But Nick Carter had seen their intention, and he realized
that there was one chance to dodge the rifle bullets, and
only one.</p>

<p>He took that chance when he speeded up the machine
to about fifty miles an hour.</p>

<p>The rough road bounced the car up in the air, and
always it was even betting whether it would come down
right side up or not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentle Christmas!&#8221; muttered Patsy. &#8220;This is some
traveling! I believe my back teeth have been jolted up into
the parting of my hair. Let her go! I can stand it if
the rest can! But I&#8217;ll need new suspender buttons when
we do stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bullets snored over their heads, the motor car being
hidden by a bluff that ran for a considerable distance along
the side of the road, just high enough to protect them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make it all right,&#8221; predicted Chick, gazing
ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a long stretch where there is no protection&mdash;or
very little&mdash;after we get away from this bluff,&#8221; remarked
Nick Carter. &#8220;Still, I doubt if they can get our
range at that distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>It appeared that the rascals could not get the range, for
when, a few minutes afterward, the detective had run the
car past the bluff and was tearing away along the path
faster than was quite safe&mdash;considering that there was a
precipice along one side over which an automobile might
easily tip if the driver were careless for a fraction of a
second or anything went wrong with the steering gear&mdash;a
volley was discharged on the hill far above without one of
the bullets coming anywhere near the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory!&#8221; yelled Patsy. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to it! We&#8217;ve
got &#8217;em licked to a frazzle! Open her up, chief! This
car for Penza and Joyalita! Watch your step! Don&#8217;t
get off the car backward! Transfer at the border line
without another fare! Wow! Who-o-op!&#8221;</p>

<p>Patsy liked to cut loose whenever there was an excuse
for a demonstration, and he felt that this was
one.</p>

<p>Nick Carter smiled at his assistant&#8217;s enthusiasm, but
never took his mind off his car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they getting ready to fire again, Chick?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t seem to be. They&#8217;re racing along on their horses,
keeping up with us or trying to get ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! They have horses, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting in front of us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way they can ride down and stop us, is
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; answered Chick.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no way, sir,&#8221; suddenly interposed Phillips.
&#8220;Begging your pardon, your highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! What is there to beg his pardon about, Phillips?
You told him the truth, I reckon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Of course,&#8221; replied Phillips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the only time to beg his pardon would be when
you lied to him, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; jerked out Patsy.</p>

<p>Nick Carter permitted himself a hasty glance up the
long, rolling hill on his left. He could see, sharply outlined
against the sky, the figures of six men on horseback,
tearing along at full gallop, and some little distance ahead
of the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to know what their game is,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>Chick overheard, but he could not offer any explanation,
so he held his peace.</p>

<p>Nick was going as fast as he dared with the car, and
now, as he came to a more difficult part of the road, on
account of its unevenness and the many stones strewn
along, he reduced the speed materially.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, chief!&#8221; called out Patsy. &#8220;We&#8217;re stopping!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep quiet!&#8221; put in Chick. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to go over
the edge, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Patsy did not reply, although, in his heart, he would have
been willing to take a chance of that, rather than let the
horsemen on the brow of the big hill make such good
time against them.</p>

<p>For some time the car rolled on at a comfortable speed
of twenty miles an hour, or thereabouts, and Nick Carter
was taking it a little easier with the relaxing of the
strain at the wheel.</p>

<p>Fast driving in an automobile is trying on the nervous
system, as well as the muscles, and rest comes in proportion
to the less number of miles per hour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>&#8220;Those fellows have gone, it seems!&#8221; remarked Patsy.
&#8220;Guess they&#8217;ve given it up!&#8221;</p>

<p>The horsemen were, indeed, out of sight. They had not
been visible for at least ten minutes.</p>

<p>Either a good horse or an automobile can travel a considerable
distance in that period of time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose they have given it up, chief?&#8221; asked
Chick, in a low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not,&#8221; was Nick Carter&#8217;s positive reply. &#8220;I&#8217;ve met
Gaspara, and I am sure he is not the man to yield until
he is sure he can&#8217;t go any farther. We&#8217;ll hear from him
again before we get to Paron.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prediction of the famous detective was verified within
another five minutes.</p>

<p>They had reached a place where the path narrowed, so
that they were much closer to the sharp edge of the
abyss on their right than they had been. At the same
time, bowlders at the foot of the slope on the left interfered
with the car there.</p>

<p>Nick Carter was endeavoring to steer a safe middle
course, and at the same time not reduce the speed too much,
when a shout of warning and alarm from Patsy made
him throttle down the power, throw in the neutral clutch,
and jam his foot on the brake.</p>

<p>The car came to a dead stop.</p>

<p>Chick swung around to see what the trouble was, and
instantly yelled to Nick to go on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hustle for all there is in her!&#8221; roared Chick.</p>

<p>His manner was so wild, that Nick Carter turned involuntarily
to the left and look up the mountain.</p>

<p>What he saw induced him to open up the engine and
send the machine jumping ahead as if it had been shot
out of a mortar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we make it?&#8221; cried Chick, wildly excited.</p>

<p>Nick Carter did not answer in words. All he did was
to try for a little more speed.</p>

<p>On the brow of the hill&mdash;with the six men who had
been riding horseback, but who now were afoot, surrounding
it&mdash;was a bowlder that the detective estimated must
weigh not less than four or five hundred pounds.</p>

<p>The bandits obviously had uprooted this enormous mass
of granite from the earth, and now were balancing it on
the very edge of the hill, preparatory to sending it hurtling
down the slope.</p>

<p>It was clear now why the rascals had been riding so
fast, to get ahead of the automobile. They intended to
crush the machine and the men in it, without giving the
victims more than the barest fighting chance.</p>

<p>There was no room to stop and let the quarter-ton mass
bound in front of them. Yet, if they tried to get past
first, they might be caught squarely in the middle!</p>

<p>It was a matter of close calculation, and, owing to the
inequalities on the hill, as well as the many little causes
that might turn the immense missile one way or the other,
this calculation could not be made with any certainty.</p>

<p>In case of doubt, it is usually the part of wisdom to
go on, instead of hanging back, and Nick Carter drove
ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! She&#8217;s a beaut!&#8221; exclaimed Patsy. &#8220;She looks
about as big as a haystack, and a durned sight more
dangerous! Straight for us, chief! That&#8217;s how she&#8217;s
coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>Patsy was holding to the side of the car with a convulsive
clutch, as he watched the gigantic stone skipping
down the mountain.</p>

<p>It was a ticklish moment.</p>

<p>Nick Carter&#8217;s eyes were on the road in front. He had
the wheel in a firm grasp, and the whole machinery of the
car was under perfect control.</p>

<p>But, with all that, unless he enjoyed a little, common,
everyday, bull luck, he did not believe he could get away
from the insensate foe tearing toward him like a thing
possessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We <i>may</i> make it!&#8221; observed Chick. &#8220;But she&#8217;s zig-zagging
in such a crazy fashion that you cannot tell what
she is going to do. Can you open her up a little
more?&#8221;</p>

<p>The motor car was tearing along faster than sixty
miles an hour now. She jumped from the road so often
and so hard that she was in the air most of the time.
As Patsy declared, she only hit the high places, and not
many of them.</p>

<p>Why the ponderous machine did not swerve from some
of the big stones or inequalities she encountered, and go
shooting over the precipice into the rock-strewn valley far
below, can never be explained.</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t. That is all that can be said.</p>

<p>Down came the great bowlder, jumping along as if it
were full of life&mdash;and deviltry!</p>

<p>It did not come straight. If it had, the problem would
not have been so difficult for Nick Carter.</p>

<p>It struck so many bumps and stones on its way that it
gave no dependable indication of where it would land when
it got to the road.</p>

<p>The only thing that looked likely was that it would
run after the car wherever it might be, and smash it to
kindling wood in sheer joy of destruction.</p>

<p>That was Patsy Garvan&#8217;s view of it, although he did not
put it in quite those words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a hunch it&#8217;s going to get us!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see how it can miss! Gee! Look at that bunch
on top of the hill, laughing! A lot of chumps! I suppose
they think it&#8217;s a joke!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speed on, Nick!&#8221; begged Chick, as the great stone flew
into the air, only about fifty yards up the mountain. &#8220;She&#8217;s
almost on top of us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick Carter needed no advice just now. Out of the
corner of his eye he had seen the bowlder hit another
one embedded in the earth, and leap away as if it had
struck a hidden mine.</p>

<p>Then it swerved in the direction the car was running,
and there seemed no possibility of avoiding it.</p>

<p>With a last effort, Nick Carter tried to squeeze a little
more speed out of the motor. He had the throttle wide
open as it was, however. He could do no more.</p>

<p>It was here that the little, common, everyday, bull luck
came on his side.</p>

<p>He had reached a slight incline&mdash;just enough to give a
slight forward impetus to the car, in addition to that which
it got from its engine.</p>

<p>On came the bowlder, and it is beyond question that, if
the car had been absolutely on level ground, or had encountered
a little rise, there would have been a collision
which could have resulted only in an awful tragedy.</p>

<p>The rock swept down! It was almost on top of the
car! Then, as the automobile took its little extra spurt
forward, the great stone skimmed the back of the machine,
actually scraping the leather cover top.</p>

<p>With a bang on the path, it ricocheted over to the edge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
of the precipice, hung there a moment, and flew off into
space!</p>

<p>The car rushed on, but the hands of Nick Carter, grasping
the steering wheel, were as cold as those of a
corpse.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br />


<small>RASCALS READY FOR ACTION.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>In a handsome room in the royal palace at Penza, capital
of Joyalita, a man in a gorgeous uniform sat at a
heavy mahogany table, writing.</p>

<p>It was very early in the morning of the eighteenth, the
day on which the council was to be held that would decide
the future fate of Joyalita.</p>

<p>A tap at the door, and in response to the gorgeous
man&#8217;s &#8220;Come in!&#8221; a slim man, in plain clothes, whose
shifty eyes took in the whole apartment at a glance, while
he ran one of his clawlike hands over his damp face,
stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Jason?&#8221; snapped the man at the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came in to tell you that everything is attended to,
Don Solado. We have Prince Marcos safely in the hands
of Gaspara, and there is nothing to interfere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, Jason! You have done well. I will see that
proper notice is taken of your services. Prince Miguel
will be in supreme power in Joyalita after the council to-day,
and I feel that I am safe in promising you an important
official position in the palace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, Don Solado,&#8221; returned Jason. &#8220;There is
a Doctor Fordham, who traveled with the prince, besides
Phillips, his man&mdash;who used to be my immediate superior
in the household&mdash;and another man, engaged to take my
place, I believe. They will perhaps come to Joyalita.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don Solado, the prime minister, and the man who had
engineered the plot to deprive Prince Marcos of his birth-right,
as well as to sell the country to the neighboring
country of Carita, got up from his chair and walked up
and down the room as a sort of vent for his anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;That rascal Phillips must not be allowed to cross the
border line of Joyalita. Where is Prince Miguel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In his own apartments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the door opened again. This
time it admitted no less a person than Prince Miguel
himself. He was in an even more gorgeous military
uniform than Don Solado, and he carried himself with
the hauteur which had distinguished him while in New
York, only with more of it.</p>

<p>Jason slipped out of the room. Miguel threw himself
into a chair near the big table and looked inquiringly at
Solado.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything has been arranged, Miguel,&#8221; said Solado,
adopting the familiar tone which was his customary one
when speaking to Prince Miguel alone. &#8220;We have that
troublesome fellow shut up in the mountains, in charge of
my amiable friend Gaspara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will be the end of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever you like, Miguel,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Gaspara&#8217;s
orders are only to take care he does not get away. But
you can depend on him to do anything that may seem
necessary to make your position at the head of Joyalita&#8217;s
government secure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything?&#8221; whispered Miguel significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything. If you would prefer that he never came back,
you have only to say the word to Gaspara, and there will
be nothing more seen of Marcos. I don&#8217;t like to go to
extremes. But, if you wish it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah! You&#8217;re too mealy-mouthed, Solado,&#8221; snarled
Miguel. &#8220;Still, we can let that matter rest for the present.
Everything ready for the council?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of it, for I had a hard and hurried trip from
New York to be here in time. When we have made the
arrangement with Carita, I shall take my place as the
reigning prince of Joyalita, and I think I shall then be in
a position to care for those who are faithful to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don Solado bowed low.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the understanding, your highness!&#8221; he said, in
smooth, significant accents.</p>

<p>Miguel left the apartment, and Don Solado went on
with his preparations for the council meeting to be held
that day, and which would settle the future course of the
government of Joyalita.</p>

<p>The whole city of Penza was in a ferment. It was
generally understood that there was to be a radical change
in the relations of the country with its near neighbor,
Carita, and there was some talk that Miguel might take
the place of Prince Marcos, &#8220;because the latter felt no
longer able to bear the cares of state.&#8221;</p>

<p>As is often the case with a population ruled by hereditary
princes, they had only a vague idea of what was
to be done, and trusted entirely to the high officials who
always had managed their affairs.</p>

<p>It was to be a gala day in Penza. Let the people have
plenty of music, flags, and military display, and they would
not be likely to interfere with more important matters.</p>

<p>That was the policy of Don Solado, who was in general
charge, and Miguel agreed with him. The rascals had
laid their plans well.</p>

<p>It had been given out that Prince Marcos was in the
United States, and that he intended to stay there.</p>

<p>This in itself was calculated to lessen somewhat the affection
the people of Joyalita had always shown for their
prince. They could not understand why he would stay
away at such a time as this, when his country surely needed
him, if ever it had.</p>

<p>Miguel went to his private room&mdash;after strolling about
the public square, in full uniform, attended by a staff of
officers almost as glittering as himself. He had shown
himself to the people, and now he felt that he might have
a little time to look after his personal affairs before he
would be called into the council chamber.</p>

<p>No sooner was he in his room than he took from a
pocket the magnificent gold watch and fob, with their blaze
of diamonds and other precious stones, and studied them
for several minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Seal of Gijon!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I have
such an able rascal as Jason to do things for me. I should
have had difficulty in carrying out my plans without this.
The seal will be necessary to make the contract binding.
I have let the Carita people believe I have the seal in my
possession, with the consent of Marcos. If I couldn&#8217;t
produce it, I should have had a hard time to explain, I am
afraid. Well, here it is, and I shall have it ready when
the time comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat musing pleasantly over his prospects, toying with
the watch and fob. For two years and more he had been
plotting to get his cousin out of the position he held, as
ruler of Joyalita.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>With Don Solado at his back, he had hatched all sorts
of schemes, but they had all fallen down, one after the
other. Some of these schemes Marcos suspected, but most
of them had been concocted and then had collapsed without
the good-natured prince knowing anything about them.</p>

<p>It was only of late that he had been convinced of
Miguel&#8217;s treachery. He had seen proofs of it even before
the attempt to kidnap and kill him in New York
City, and now he was as determined to save his country
as his cousin was to hand it over to another power, with
himself as the real ruler.</p>

<p>Miguel had gone over the whole plot in his mind, and
had just come to the conclusion that it was absolutely
perfect, so that it could not fail, when there came a sharp
tap-tap at his door, followed by a thump.</p>

<p>This was the signal agreed upon between him and Solado
to show that it was the latter who demanded entrance.</p>

<p>Miguel hastily stuffed the Seal of Gijon in his pocket
and strode across the thickly carpeted floor to unlock the
door.</p>

<p>Don Solado stumbled in, trembling and weak, and with
great beads of perspiration standing forth on his flabby
white face.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s here!&#8221; he gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marcos!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; shrieked Miguel. Then, dropping his voice, he
asked angrily: &#8220;What are you talking about, Solado? Are
you crazy? Isn&#8217;t Marcos up in the mountains, with Gaspara?
You told me that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. I know what I told you. He was with Gaspara.
But&mdash;he has escaped!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miguel sat back in his chair, his legs extended and his
arms by his sides, staring stupidly at Solado.</p>

<p>&#8220;How was it?&#8221; he managed to ask at last. &#8220;How did
he escape?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just ran away when Gaspara&#8217;s men were not attending
to their duty,&#8221; growled Solado. &#8220;He might not have
got off even then, only that he had a motor car waiting
for him not far away, with his physician, a Doctor Fordham,
and a valet. It is all that fellow Jason&#8217;s fault. He did
not take proper precautions. He knew those two men
were with the prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he do anything to make them safe?&#8221; asked
Miguel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He gave them something in their coffee that made
them sleep, at Mala&#8217;s house in Paron. But they woke up
in the morning, trailed the car to Gaspara&#8217;s place, and took
Marcos away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In fact, a blunder has been made all around,&#8221; snarled
Miguel. &#8220;Well, we must do something, quickly, or we
shall have Marcos here before the treaty is signed. He is
on his way, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know he is. He was seen in Paron this morning.
He went to Mala&#8217;s for some of his baggage that had
been taken out of the car, and then started for Penza. I
got a telegram from Mala.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mala deserves recognition. I&#8217;ll see that he has it if we
keep Marcos away. The question is, how can we do
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me twenty cavalrymen, and I&#8217;ll keep him out of
Joyalita,&#8221; suddenly declared Solado, with more energy than
he had heretofore shown. &#8220;Young Lieutenant Trenzini
is aching to have some chance to show his loyalty to you.
What is more, he hates Marcos.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; observed Miguel thoughtfully. &#8220;Trenzini
wanted to marry that niece of yours, Claudia, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But Marcos has been polite to her a few times,
and she thinks she can get him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she will. I have no objection,&#8221; sneered Miguel.
&#8220;But he will not be ruler of Joyalita after to-day, so perhaps
she won&#8217;t want him then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she will,&#8221; was Don Solado&#8217;s quick reply. &#8220;I believe
the girl would be fool enough to marry him if he
were utterly ruined&mdash;if he would have her. Young women
of her kind never have any sense, it seems to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that is of no consequence,&#8221; shrugged Miguel. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
give orders for Lieutenant Trenzini to take twenty troopers
and go and meet this automobile with Marcos and his men.
That&#8217;s what you mean, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then. Go on with your preparations for
the council, and I will show myself in the public square
again, after I get Trenzini off. We&#8217;ll beat Marcos
yet.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE AMBUSH IN THE PASS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;We are about fifteen miles on the Carita side of the
border line,&#8221; remarked Nick Carter, as he sat in his
big car outside Mala&#8217;s hotel in Paron, waiting for Phillips
to bring out the few things he had left in the house.
&#8220;We shall be able to get to Penza easily before noon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t have a breakdown,&#8221; observed Patsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shan&#8217;t break down,&#8221; returned Nick. &#8220;I looked
the car over too closely the last time we had to stop for
tire trouble and stripped gears. She&#8217;s as sound as a
bell now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course she is,&#8221; put in Chick. &#8220;What makes you
talk about breaking down, Patsy? You know we couldn&#8217;t
afford it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; rejoined Patsy; &#8220;if we did break
down, we&#8217;d have to commandeer another car in this
country, and perhaps have a scrap before we got what
we wanted. I&#8217;m getting stiff for lack of exercise.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer to this. Nick Carter and Chick
both smiled at the truculence of Patsy Garvan. They
knew he meant what he said, but they did not desire his
wishes to be fulfilled, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Phillips came out with a traveling bag and big coat
belonging to Marcos, stowed them in the back of the car,
and got in himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t see anything of the watch, I suppose, Phillips?&#8221;
asked Nick, in a low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied Phillips, shaking his head. &#8220;The
Seal of Gijon is in Penza, I have no doubt. We will
get it when we are there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Phillips,&#8221; said Nick Carter sternly.
&#8220;We will get it. What had Mala to say for himself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see him, sir. No one seems to be in the
hotel at all. Or, if there are people about, they are
keeping out of sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick nodded, and started the car. Then he stopped
and put on the heavy coat Phillips had just brought
out. He had a soft cap&mdash;an extra one that was in his
baggage&mdash;which he pulled over his eyes. The other had
been lost. He drew on a pair of gloves, and once more
touched the electric starter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>&#8220;She&#8217;s running smoothly,&#8221; remarked the irrepressible
Patsy, as the car glided down the slight incline of the
main street of Paron. &#8220;After all the racket she&#8217;s had,
up in the mountains and along the road before that, we
could not blame her if she did jolt a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got to go smoothly,&#8221; said Chick. &#8220;Because we
have to be in Penza before noon, if we hobble into the
city on rims, instead of rubber.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick Carter took no part in this chat. He was listening
to the steady purring of the engine, and it was
music to his ears that he did not care to disturb.</p>

<p>They had to go rather carefully down this narrow
street, for it was very crooked, and some of the nearly
naked children of the place had the same inclination to
get in front of the car that automobilists meet with
everywhere.</p>

<p>After about a quarter of a mile of this sort of work,
they turned into the wider highroad, that gave them an
opportunity to go faster. They were fairly on their way
toward Penza now.</p>

<p>It was at this instant that Phillips leaned forward to
speak to the detective, in his passionless tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not trouble about traffic regulations, sir,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;There are no speed limits in Carita, nor in
Joyalita, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good to know,&#8221; smiled Nick.</p>

<p>He let out the engine, and the car responded instantly.
They were soon flying along at fifty miles an
hour, which became sixty when they struck a down
grade.</p>

<p>The detective felt the keen enjoyment which comes to
the enthusiastic motorist when he has a big, flexible engine
under his control, and a long, wide roadway before
him.</p>

<p>They roared down a slope, thrashed their way up a
tough incline on &#8220;high,&#8221; and sped along a plateau as
smooth almost as a ballroom floor, with the sun warming
their shoulders and the sweet breath of full-blown
trees and tropical vegetation in their nostrils.</p>

<p>Phillips again leaned forward as they came near the
end of the plateau and touched Carter on the shoulder to
call his attention. He had to raise his voice to the
utmost to make the detective hear him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven miles more, sir!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Then we shall
be clear of Carita. You see that tall white post ahead
of us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That marks the boundary line. When we are past
that we are in Joyalita. We shall get to Penza in time,
with something to spare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m aiming for,&#8221; answered Nick Carter,
as he glanced at the boundary post.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two miles beyond that post and the shanty by the
side of it, where the customs officer is keeping watch, we
go through a pass. That is the real frontier, although
the boundary post was put there many years ago, before
it was quite settled where the line is, and is generally
recognized.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a long speech for Phillips, especially at the
top of his voice, and he dropped back in his seat,
exhausted.</p>

<p>The car began to glide down a long grade, and Nick
was hoping the customs officer would not bother him.
He wanted to get up good speed passing the house, so
that he could take the hill facing him with plenty of
power on.</p>

<p>Just as he got to the house, however, a boy of about
twelve years of age ran out and stood almost in front
of the car, waving for him to stop.</p>

<p>Nick was inclined to flash past. He was in no mood
to parley with a customs officer, especially when represented
only by a small boy.</p>

<p>But another thought came to him, and he slowed down.</p>

<p>The boy ran to the car and jumped upon the running
board, so that his face was level with the detective&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, my boy?&#8221; asked Nick, in Spanish.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is danger, your highness,&#8221; replied the lad, in
the same tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know me, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, your highness,&#8221; was the quick response, while
the dark eyes flashed with a friendly light. &#8220;You are
Prince Marcos. My father has said all along that you
would be back in time to save your country. We used
to live in Joyalita. We love Marcos.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the danger you speak of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Troops in the pass, your highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Troops in the pass, eh? How many? Where did
they come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw them from my bedroom window,&#8221; explained
the boy. &#8220;Father has a long telescope, and I looked
through it at the pass about two hours ago. About twenty
soldiers were galloping up from Penza. I saw them
get off their horses among the rocks, and some of them
lighted cigarettes, as if they were going to wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; ejaculated Patsy. &#8220;We may have a scrap, after
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty soldiers, on horseback!&#8221; commented Chick.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not surprised. Are you, chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; returned Nick. &#8220;Of course, that fellow
Jason has reported that I am on my way. I know Solado
is in Penza, and probably Miguel has got there, too. It
would be awkward for them to have Prince Marcos
turn up to-day. They would do anything to prevent it,
and as they have the soldiers at their command, it is
the most likely thing in the world for them to try to
stop me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think the soldiers were against Marcos,&#8221; remarked
Patsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of them are, evidently,&#8221; was Nick Carter&#8217;s rejoinder.
&#8220;Of course, these fellows in the pass have been
picked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; assented Patsy. &#8220;There are always some
dirty hounds in every army. What are we going to do?
Shoot them, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to break through somehow,&#8221; replied
Nick sternly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see any of them from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re hiding,&#8221; explained the boy. &#8220;Two of them
were watching the road when I looked through the telescope
a little while ago. The others were among the trees
and rocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d better try to push through,&#8221; advised
Phillips. &#8220;The boy says there are twenty. There
may be thirty. We are only four.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; growled Patsy,
in extreme disgust. &#8220;You won&#8217;t be asked to fight. Prince
Marcos and the doctor and I can clean them out ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will fight if you go on,&#8221; returned Phillips simply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>The valet meant what he said. He was a noncombatant
from preference. But, like many men of his quiet, unobtrusive
nature, he would fight like a wild cat when
cornered.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go on,&#8221; said Nick Carter, in a matter-of-fact
tone. &#8220;Thank you, my boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>He took a gold coin from his pocket and gave it to
the lad, who literally fell off the running board in astonishment
and delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, your highness! I hope you will get to
Penza all right!&#8221; cried the boy after them as the car
started and began to roll away at a good speed to make
the next hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better keep your heads low,&#8221; suggested Nick.
&#8220;Phillips, I am sorry we have got you into this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, your highness! The saints will preserve
us!&#8221; was the valet&#8217;s fervent response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Full speed ahead, chief!&#8221; called out Patsy. &#8220;Gee!
This is where we begin to live!&#8221;</p>

<p>Chick said nothing. But he took his automatic revolver
from his pocket and examined it affectionately.</p>

<p>As the car took the hill it was shadowed for some distance
by large trees, which not only shut off their view
of the pass, but prevented the soldiers seeing the car
until it was comparatively near.</p>

<p>Nick Carter&#8217;s pistol was ready to his hand in the right
pocket of his overcoat, and his two assistants had their
weapons in their fingers.</p>

<p>What Phillips was doing was his own business, but
there was a determined expression in his usually stolid
face which promised well when the clash should come.</p>

<p>There was a dip toward the pass, too, so that the car
was out of sight until it reached the brow of the last
hill&mdash;always supposing it had not been sighted from the
rise on which the boy&#8217;s home stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll coast down this one,&#8221; observed Nick. &#8220;If we
can crash right through those fellows without having to
stop and fight them, it will save time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully!&#8221; roared Patsy. &#8220;Tear into them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick Carter switched off his power with a touch of the
magneto key. Then, with his gears taken off, so that
they were in neutral, he let the car surge down the
long slope by its own momentum.</p>

<p>There was no noise from the big machine save for the
faint rasp of the wide nonskid tires on the road.</p>

<p>Faster and faster it shot along, until, as they reached
a speed of more than a mile a minute, the immense body
began to sway from side to side in a way that made
Phillips&#8217; teeth chatter, as he clung to the side.</p>

<p>Chick and Patsy were too much interested in the prospect
of a fight to care how fast they were going.</p>

<p>The automobile was halfway down the hill before the
sentries sighted it. They had been listening for the sound
of the engine. By shutting it off, Nick Carter had fooled
them completely.</p>

<p>Suddenly a hoarse shout broke from the lips of one
of the two soldiers. He wheeled around and darted down
the slope toward the pass, bellowing: &#8220;The car! Here
it is! Prince Marcos is here!&#8221;</p>

<p>He called over his shoulder to his comrade to shoot,
and kept on his own way to warn the others hiding in
the narrow pass.</p>

<p>The second sentry did his best to carry out his comrade&#8217;s
advice, and brought his carbine to his shoulder.</p>

<p>But he could not take steady aim at a car that was
moving toward him at the rate of nearly seventy miles an
hour. He might as well have leveled his gun at a flash
of lightning.</p>

<p>The soldier did his best, however. He pointed his
gun in a general way at Nick Carter&#8217;s head and pulled
the trigger.</p>

<p>There was a crack, hardly heard through the shouts
and the rushing of the car, and the bullet went six feet
too high, at least.</p>

<p>Then Phillips came to the front. He brought out a
revolver, and, as the car came level with the soldier who
had just fired, the valet sent a bullet into his chest.</p>

<p>There was a shriek, followed by a gurgling groan,
from the trooper, and down he went in a huddled heap.
The car surged past, and those in it hardly had time to
see what became of the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully for you, Phillips!&#8221; shouted Patsy. &#8220;You
plugged him good! Wow! You&#8217;re all right, old socks!&#8221;</p>

<p>The trouble was not over yet, however.</p>

<p>When the first sentry rushed back to the pass, his
cries aroused the whole troop, who were dozing among
the bowlders at the other end.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Trenzini had wrapped himself in his cavalry
cloak, and, with a cigarette between his lips, had
found a nice shady spot, with green grass growing thickly
on the ground. It was an ideal place for a rest, and the
good lieutenant was making the most of it.</p>

<p>He was the first to hear the warning cry of the
sentry. With a bound, he was on his feet.</p>

<p>The clattering of the accouterments told that his men had
followed his example and were ready for orders. He
rushed across the high ground and hailed the excited
sentinel.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded the lieutenant. &#8220;Do you say
the car is coming? Are you sure? Did you see Prince
Marcos?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; returned the man, after gasping a moment
to recover his breath. &#8220;I saw the prince. He is driving.
It is almost here now. It came before we expected it.
The trees, and the motor shut off, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>From the other side of the pass came to their ears
the sound of the sentry&#8217;s carbine, followed by the spiteful
roar of Phillips&#8217; revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, men!&#8221; bellowed Lieutenant Trenzini. &#8220;Line
the road, and, as the car comes through, be ready to
shoot. Aim low and shoot to kill!&#8221; he added savagely.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve killed one of our men, but we&#8217;ll make them pay
for that. We shall be backed up at Penza. Don&#8217;t forget
that. Prince Miguel&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a scampering of heavily booted men as
his soldiers rushed to obey their officer&#8217;s orders, and he
did not proceed any farther. He knew his men were
all with him.</p>

<p>As Nick Carter had easily conjectured, they were all
&#8220;picked&#8221; men.</p>

<p>Four or five of them had already reached the road
away from the bowlders, and were taking up their positions
to command the car with their carbines, when,
from the other end of the pass, arose a frenzied howl
of alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! Look!&#8221; shouted the soldier who had gone a
little farther along the pass than his comrades. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
charge! What are we to do!&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier was so terrified that he turned to see which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
way to run. But the other troopers were behind him,
and he could not escape.</p>

<p>They were standing only about a hundred feet from
the end of the pass.</p>

<p>A moment later the car came out of the pass like a
torpedo. It cleared the hundred feet at a single leap.
Nick Carter had no time to steer clear of the soldiers
crowding into the roadway.</p>

<p>The fact that he knew they would have sent a shattering
volley into the car if they had had time, consoled
him somewhat for the desperate action he was compelled
to take.</p>

<p>Like a great juggernaut, the automobile plunged through
the ranks of the startled troopers&mdash;a very fiend of devastation!</p>

<p>From the road arose a chorus of heavy groans and
maddened shrieks, and the swaying of the front wheels
told Nick Carter and his companions that they were making
an awful pathway over living bodies.</p>

<p>If was all over as soon as it had begun. The car
cleared the pass and flashed along the road, still on its
way to Penza.</p>

<p>How many men had been killed or horribly mutilated
could not be told.</p>

<p>The detective kept his car going. This was war, and
mercy was not to be considered.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Trenzini let loose a torrent of frenzied
oaths. He was insane with impotent rage, and he shook
his fist after the flying car like the maniac he had
become.</p>

<p>Then he turned to his men, half of whom were groaning
and writhing on the ground, while the remainder
seemed to have lost their senses, courage and all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire! Fire!&#8221; he bellowed. &#8220;Curse you! Why don&#8217;t
you fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>The habit of obedience is irresistible with the trained
soldier. As the order came, those of the troop who
were uninjured raised their carbines and pointed them
at the fast-disappearing car.</p>

<p>They rapped out a scattering volley. It was wholly
ineffective.</p>

<p>The bullets whistled and sung around the car, sending
up flicks of dust from the road, or whining over the
heads of the occupants. One bullet even struck a mud-guard,
making a slight dent on the very edge.</p>

<p>Without aim, and in a condition of panic, how could
men be expected to shoot straight?</p>

<p>With all this, the speed of the car was its main safeguard.
In a few seconds it was entirely out of range,
and directly afterward vanished around a bend in the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory!&#8221; shouted Patsy Garvan. &#8220;That&#8217;s one for us.
Is there any other place where they can lay for us like
that, Phillips?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. That is the only part of the road where there
would be a chance of ambush,&#8221; replied Phillips quietly.
&#8220;If there is any more attempt to stop us, it must be
made out in the open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they will dare that,&#8221; observed Nick
Carter.</p>

<p>He was right. No one interfered with them again, and
it was just ten minutes before noon when he marched
into the council hall, in the full uniform of Prince Marcos,
and placed his veto on the treaty that would have
sold Joyalita into the hands of Carita and put Prince
Miguel on the throne that belonged to his cousin.</p>

<p>He had already had the Seal of Gijon taken from the
rascal who meant to use it to further his own schemes.</p>

<p>When the car rattled up to the palace, there were plenty
of people who thought they recognized Marcos, and the
cheers with which he was received proved his popularity.
At the same time it struck a death knell to the black
heart of Miguel.</p>

<p>Phillips was delighted. He led Nick to the prince&#8217;s
chamber and quickly dressed him in his uniform of
state.</p>

<p>When the work of dressing was complete, Phillips
stood back, and, with a low bow, murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your highness, Prince Marcos! Who can deny it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miguel, Don Solado, Jason, and Lieutenant Trenzini
are all in prison now. They were charged with high
treason, and although Marcos might have passed over
their crimes, in his easy-going way, his minister would
not allow it. Even a monarch cannot do as he pleases
in affairs of state.</p>

<p>It was not till a month after Nick Carter, in the person
of Marcos, had saved Joyalita that the proceedings
against the traitors were begun, however.</p>

<p>Through the astute Phillips, it was announced officially
that Prince Marcos had been overcome by the journey
to Penza and the excitement of the council, and
must not see any one for several weeks.</p>

<p>Nick Carter, Chick, and Patsy were all smuggled away.
They wanted to reach New York as soon as they could
get there.</p>

<p>They found Marcos almost entirely recovered from his
wound.</p>

<p>Nick Carter wasted no time in sending him down to
Joyalita to take his rightful place.</p>

<p>When Marcos went he was accompanied not only by
his mother, but also by Claudia Solado and hers. This
was because a wedding was to take place soon at Penza.
Marcos made Claudia his princess.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s some girl, is Claudia!&#8221; remarked Patsy Garvan,
as he listened to a letter his chief had just received
from Penza, two months after their adventures down in
Joyalita. &#8220;If I were not a married man, I believe I would
have tried to steal her from Marcos. What do <i>you</i> say,
Chick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s worth any man&#8217;s stealing, I should say,&#8221; laughed
Chick.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is worthy of Prince Marcos, who saved his country,&#8221;
added Nick Carter. &#8220;And that&#8217;s praise enough for
any young woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come off!&#8221; rejoined Patsy. &#8220;What are you giving
us, chief? Marcos is all right, of course. But the man
who really saved Joyalita was a gentleman by the name
of Nicholas Carter, and you know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My two assistants gave me good help or it never
could have been done,&#8221; was Nick Carter&#8217;s modest response.</p>

TWENTY PRECIOUS MINUTES.</h3>
</div>

<p>It seemed to Nash that an eternity passed before he
finally brought himself together, groped for the candles,
found and lighted them. By this time Miss Breen had
come back to the world again, and when he spoke to her
she moved, and afterward drew herself erect, leaning
against the damp chamber wall.</p>

<p>Nash comforted her as best he could, but she seemed
dazed, and unable to understand. Her first coherent
words were:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;time&mdash;is&mdash;it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nash showed her his watch. She bent down to it, holding
it between her hands, gazing steadily upon the white
dial.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-five minutes after seven,&#8221; she murmured. Nash
nodded. Suddenly she lurched to her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&mdash;we can&#8217;t die&mdash;like rats in a hole!&#8221; she exclaimed
hysterically. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you do something? Why do
you stand like that? I&#8217;ll help you! We&#8217;ve only thirty-five
minutes left!&#8221;</p>

<p>A swift throb of pity surged into Nash&#8217;s heart. He
fancied that horror and fear had driven the girl out of her
right mind. Perhaps it was just as well, he reasoned
dully, for when the time came&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He steeled himself against the fear that was slowly
mastering him. He must not give up until the last minute
of the precious thirty-five.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try again,&#8221; he said aloud. &#8220;I feel&mdash;stronger now.
Hold those candles higher&mdash;higher. There&mdash;that&#8217;s right!&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more he tore at the pitiless barrier of stone that
shut them in from the stars. His new strength was not
imaginary; he moved huge rocks which, a few minutes
before, he could not budge. But the struggle was not for
long. A great slab of granite met his fingers, and although
he exerted every ounce of his strength&mdash;until all the muscles
in his tired body seemed to tear themselves asunder&mdash;the
cold, slippery rock refused to give.</p>

<p>He sank down in the mire of the cleared space, breathing
heavily. &#8220;It&#8217;s useless,&#8221; he panted. &#8220;Might as well tackle a
sheet of armor plate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first of the two candles burned down, and Miss
Breen dropped it to the floor. The other one was half
gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Careful&mdash;of the light,&#8221; he said, wondering as he said
it why he had thought of such a thing. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t any
more matches.&#8221;</p>

<p>The minutes ticked away. The water dripped steadily
from the roof, splashing on his hands. Fascinated, he
stared at the sickly yellow flame that pulsated atop the
remaining candle.</p>

<p>Then, with a quickening of his pulse, he jerked himself
erect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see how that candle burns?&#8221; he burst out, his
voice ringing strongly. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t last so long if there
wasn&#8217;t a lot of air.&#8221; He sniffed critically. &#8220;And it&#8217;s fresh
and clean, too! Why didn&#8217;t I think of it before?&#8221;</p>

<p>A new color sprang to the girl&#8217;s cheeks as Nash finished.
She seemed to sense a triumphant note in his steady
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Miss Breen!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Follow me with
that candle! Hurry now!&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the way to the distant corner, where the cases
of dynamite were stacked. Without a word of explanation,
he began to pull them down recklessly. Finally he
gave a shout.</p>

<p>&#8220;An air vent!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I thought so. The boys told
me something about this crevice&mdash;but I didn&#8217;t pay any
attention at the time. Come along, Miss Breen! We&#8217;ll
cheat this explosion yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hole, or, rather, a crevice, ran up at an angle, and
was barely wide enough for the passage of a body. Nash
took the candle and forced the girl in before him. They
crawled slowly and painfully ahead.</p>

<p>A gust of fresh air struck their faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re almost there,&#8221; Nash shouted. &#8220;Don&#8217;t stop! Keep
up your nerve! You&#8217;re doing splendidly, Miss Breen!
We&#8217;ll have to make a run for it after we get out!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Breen, who was well ahead, at last uttered a little
cry. She was scrambling out into the soft moonlit world.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; Nash drank deep of the air. &#8220;It&#8217;s all over
but the shouting now. One more pull and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Breen was standing free now, amid the scrub oak
and aspens that grew thickly about the mouth of the hole.
Nash himself, his head and shoulders well out of the
crevice, and ready to give the final effort that would serve
to lift him beside the girl, suddenly felt a weight crush
against his legs. For the moment he struggled desperately;
then stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; Miss Breen asked, frowning.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you hurry?&#8221; She steadied herself, and
stretched out a hand. &#8220;Here, take hold. Maybe I can help
some.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nash took in a deep breath, and put forth a determined
effort, but it was a useless exertion. His legs were
wedged firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m stuck, somehow,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some loose rock is
pressing against my legs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuck?&#8221; Miss Breen cried aloud. &#8220;Oh, not now! Not
when we&#8217;re all but free. Try hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nash did not need the girl&#8217;s encouragement to urge him
to a greater endeavor. Savagely he jerked, but the sharp
edges of the rock were cutting into his flesh, and the pain
caused by this effort brought a smothered groan to his
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t budge,&#8221; he said at last, strangely calm now that
he realized his helpless position. &#8220;Listen to me, Miss
Breen,&#8221; he commanded, fumbling for his watch. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got to run like a March hare.&#8221; He peered closely at the
watch, barely able to distinguish the hands in the moonlight.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve less than half an hour to get away. This
whole mountaintop will go up like a skyrocket in twenty
minutes. And if you&#8217;re within half a mile&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes widened with terror; she was instantly
aware of the situation. &#8220;But you!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You can&#8217;t&mdash;remain
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t waste time arguing,&#8221; Nash answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but surely I can do something,&#8221; she faltered.
&#8220;Tell me where the men are. I&#8217;ll warn them that you
are&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible, Miss Breen. They are over a mile
from here, and you can only cross the river at one point.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
A man used to the trails couldn&#8217;t cover the distance under
an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;the wires!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I can cut them.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the instant Nash entertained that hope. Yet, after
reflection he knew such a quest was useless.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve come out of the chamber on the opposite side
of the mountain,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;You could never in the
world find your way around to the mouth of the drift.
There are no paths.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Breen continued to gaze upon him with terror-stricken
eyes. The pain in Nash&#8217;s legs was becoming more
and more severe. He fought back the desire to groan,
although he knew his lips were trembling and that his
face must be very white.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, Miss Breen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;go away from
here! There is yet a change that I can free myself before&mdash;&mdash;
Anyway, you can do no good. Go straight down the
slope, and turn under the high cliffs below the pipe line.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sank down beside him, overcome, as Nash fancied,
by the horror of it all. He began to fear that she would
have no strength left with which to run.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;time is it?&#8221; she begged. Yet before he could
take out his watch her hand crept into his pocket, removing
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a quarter to eight,&#8221; she announced. She held the
watch in her hands, forgetting to return it.</p>

<p>Nash pleaded with her once more. &#8220;You must get away!
You must! If the worst should happen&mdash;yours would be
a useless sacrifice. You can do me no good by remaining.
Your own life is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t!&#8221; she choked, interrupting him. &#8220;I&mdash;I
am not worthy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared into her partly hidden face. &#8220;Miss Breen,&#8221;
he commanded firmly, &#8220;every minute is precious. Pull
yourself together. You must be brave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;I must be brave.&#8221; Never had
her voice sounded so strangely. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been&mdash;been a coward
all these months. Now&mdash;now I&#8217;m going to be brave.
I&#8217;m going to tell you the truth. You&#8217;ve sacrificed everything
for me. I&mdash;I should have known before.&#8221; She
caught at her breath, and forced back a sob. &#8220;Mr. Nash,
I&mdash;I have been living a lie. I am not merely an Eastern
girl out here for my health, as you suspected&mdash;as I led
you to believe. I&mdash;I am a spotter employed by the city
of Los Angeles.&#8221;</p>

<p>The declaration came like a blow in the face to Nash.
For the moment he forgot his pain&mdash;forgot the situation&mdash;forgot
that in a few minutes the whole mountaintop
would be a living volcano.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;a spotter?&#8221; he asked, scarcely believing his ears.
And then, feeling a throb of pity for the girl, he changed.
&#8220;Well, what does it matter? There has been no harm
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there <i>has</i> been harm done,&#8221; she stammered, looking
at him with bewildered, misted eyes. &#8220;There <i>has</i> been
harm done! I&mdash;I have informed the authorities at Los
Angeles, and&mdash;and you are to be arrested before the week
is out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Informed the authorities!&#8221; Nash could only stare at
her. &#8220;Arrested?&#8221; He started to say something, then hesitated.
He fancied, suddenly, that he understood. Miss
Breen, breaking under the strain, was bereft of her right
mind. Her declarations were but the wanderings of a
shattered brain.</p>

<p>He sought to humor her. He must get her away from
this spot before it was too late.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, Miss Breen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry.
Everything will come out all right. Only&mdash;only you mustn&#8217;t
stay here another instant. You must run away&mdash;now
please&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t seem to understand,&#8221; she burst out,
almost in a frenzy. &#8220;You&#8217;re not taking what I say to be
serious. Can&#8217;t you realize the truth? I have told the
authorities&mdash;the police&mdash;and they were to arrest you. It
would mean&mdash;mean a long term in prison. And&mdash;and I
would be the cause of it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s earnest, almost pleading assertion aroused
Nash. She appeared to be telling the truth. And yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you tell the authorities?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&mdash;that you were not following the city specifications.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her declaration seemed so absurd that, despite the situation,
Nash laughed. If he had a moment since entertained
one atom of belief in Miss Breen&#8217;s statements, this
final declaration killed it. Too well he knew he had followed
the specifications from the head office; had double-checked
them, assured himself that every figure was right.
He would be willing to wager his life that his work&mdash;the
work he was held directly and solely responsible for&mdash;was
flawless.</p>

<p>Further argument, he felt, would be useless. The moments
were far too precious. So, when he at last spoke, it
was upon another subject; one that appeared to him to be
more vital.</p>

<p>&#8220;What time is it, Miss Breen?&#8221; he asked calmly.</p>

<p>Her eyes sought the watch, which she still held. &#8220;It&mdash;it
is ten minutes to eight,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve yet time,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;Don&#8217;t argue. It
won&#8217;t do any good. Get away&mdash;now, while you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes from the watch. He fancied her
cheeks were flaming with color.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;is the button to be pressed promptly at eight?&#8221; she
questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Those were my orders. You must not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But suppose something happened,&#8221; she interrupted, &#8220;to
prevent the explosion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the explosion doesn&#8217;t occur at eight o&#8217;clock&mdash;isn&#8217;t it
probable it will not occur at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Breen!&#8221; he half shouted. &#8220;Don&#8217;t stay here and
waste time with such foolish questions. You&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If&mdash;if the explosion doesn&#8217;t come at eight&mdash;it won&#8217;t
come at all. Isn&#8217;t that&mdash;right?&#8221; she burst out.</p>

<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, Miss Breen, get away from here.
Can&#8217;t you understand? Can&#8217;t you see how senseless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Breen did a totally unexpected thing. She laughed
loudly. Then, even as Nash was staring as upon a mad-woman,
she stopped, trembled, and instantly had thrown
herself face down to the rocks, pillowing her head in her
arms, and sobbing wildly, hysterically, like a frightened
child.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX.<br />


AFTERWARD.</h3>
</div>

<p>To say that Nash was amazed at this mingled display of
tears and laughter, would be putting it mildly. He
reached out his arm and attempted to grip hers. But she
had fallen just a few inches too far away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;Miss Breen,&#8221; he called. &#8220;Miss Breen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her sobbing had stopped as abruptly as it had come.
And although she did not answer him, there came to his
ears another sound, which like the striking of a gong in
a fire house, immediately sent his pulses racing like mad.</p>

<p>Some one was shouting. Lifting his head Nash answered
back. Then the still night air was rent by a chorus
of maddening yells. Nash could not reason it all out for
the moment, but turning his eyes, he saw far below him
a dozen men climbing up the slope&mdash;and at their head
he made out the figure of his subforeman&mdash;the man who
was to have pressed the button that would have torn
asunder the mountaintop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; came the leader&#8217;s voice. &#8220;That you, Nash?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nash answered. Almost instantly, it appeared, he was
surrounded by the members of the &#8220;coyote&#8221; gang.</p>

<p>&#8220;We thought something was up,&#8221; the foreman was saying,
&#8220;and thank God there was, too! I pressed the button
at eight o&#8217;clock&mdash;and nothing happened. I knew the battery
was O. K., so the only thing I could think of was that
the wires had been broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At&mdash;at eight o&#8217;clock!&#8221; exclaimed Nash. &#8220;What are you
talking about? It isn&#8217;t that time yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with your watch?&#8221; The foreman
was laughing. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s blamed near nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nash frowned. &#8220;Take care of Miss Breen,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;She&#8217;s fainted, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the men handed him his watch. He looked at
it. The hands marked eight-forty. Then, in a flash, he
understood. Miss Breen had, for some reason or other,
lied to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How in the deuce did you get wedged in here?&#8221; the
foreman interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Breen and I were inspecting the rock chamber.
The tunnel caved in&mdash;must have cut the wires at the same
time. Then I discovered the air vent, and we managed
to get out&mdash;that is, Miss Breen did. Something&#8217;s got my
legs in a vise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Luckily the men were prepared for trouble, and they
had brought some tools. So, after fifteen minutes of
hard work, Nash was released. His legs were cut and
cramped, but otherwise he was uninjured.</p>

<p>As soon as he had restored the circulation to his stiff
legs by walking around for a minute or two, he concerned
himself with Miss Breen. She was still in a dead
faint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plucky girl,&#8221; he muttered to himself. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t faint
until it was all over. And a spotter, too.&#8221; He looked down
into her white face. &#8220;Wonder why she lied to me about
the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>An idea did come to him that might have explained this
last, and, although he would have liked to believe it, the
thing seemed all but impossible.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get Miss Breen home,&#8221; he said, speaking
abruptly to the foreman. &#8220;Get two of the boys to rig up a
stretcher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does she live?&#8221; inquired the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Elkhorn Ranch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So?&#8221; The foreman looked surprised. &#8220;That&#8217;s where
Macmillan stayed. Some folks from there came in about
seven o&#8217;clock to claim his body.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nash frowned. Macmillan living at the same ranch
as Miss Breen! Perhaps this explained something definite
as to the cause of that certain night&#8217;s affair.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later Miss Breen came to. She was still
very weak, and Nash did not question her, much as he
would have liked to do so. Instead, he gave her in charge
of two of the boys, who carried her down the slope where
the ponies had been left. Here she was lifted to a saddle,
and supported on both sides, while the journey toward
the Elkhorn Ranch was begun.</p>

<p>Nash, meanwhile, indifferent to the strain he had been
under, and to the questions which still puzzled him, immediately
issued orders, and the remaining group of men,
led by himself and the foreman, tramped over the hill and
down the opposite side to where the tunnel mouth yawned.</p>

<p>It took the best part of an hour to remove the d&eacute;bris
from the drift, and to repair the broken wire. With this
completed, they went down to where the horses were
grazing, and were shortly on their way to camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll postpone the fireworks until to-morrow night,&#8221;
Nash said, in answer to the foreman&#8217;s inquiry.</p>

<p>The foreman apparently was realizing what a narrow
escape Nash had suffered this night, and the single incident
that had prevented the explosion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; he muttered, while he and Nash were
riding side by side. &#8220;Think of what might have happened&mdash;had
that wire been intact! The more I think of it the
weaker I get.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d never have found a piece of me,&#8221; Nash answered.
&#8220;Nor of Miss Breen, for that matter. What a disappearance!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is this&mdash;Miss Breen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Nash answered frankly, &#8220;as long as you have
been doing your work faithfully, I might as well confess.
She&#8217;s a spotter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The foreman swore. &#8220;A spotter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But somehow I never feel afraid. Never have.
Oh, I know how the majority of men feel about such
things. Spotters represent all that is undesirable to them&mdash;and
they take the easiest method of ridding themselves
of so-called trouble-makers. Seems foolish to me. A man
who is doing his work right should not fear inspection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked the foreman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I? Camp Forty-seven is run on the
square. My books are always open. I&#8217;m willing that the
whole engineering board should come here and make a personal
examination.&#8221;</p>

<p>The foreman turned and glanced swiftly, curiously, into
Nash&#8217;s face. &#8220;There&#8217;s no danger of such a thing happening,
is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t probable,&#8221; Nash answered. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>The foreman shrugged and laughed. &#8220;Oh, nothing. Of
course, I&#8217;m not worrying&mdash;it isn&#8217;t my place to do so. You&#8217;re
the responsible party here, and you&#8217;re too clever a man to
leave such things as&mdash;as footprints or thumb marks about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not insinuating that I might&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Nash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; exclaimed the other, interrupting. &#8220;But
often a spotter&mdash;particularly a woman, is likely to get a
line on some things that ought to be&mdash;well, kept under
cover.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had reached camp by this time, and when the foreman
finished with his declaration, he laughed again, and
turned into a dark side street.</p>

<p>&#8220;See you later, Mr. Nash,&#8221; he called back.</p>

<p>Nash continued alone up the main street of the camp,
pondering over the man&#8217;s conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows something&mdash;or thinks he does, anyway,&#8221;
Nash muttered to himself. &#8220;If I wasn&#8217;t absolutely sure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
myself&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He stopped, laughing at his own suspicions.
&#8220;Nonsense. I&#8217;ll see that fellow in the morning, and find
out just what he&#8217;s aiming at.&#8221;</p>

MORE COMPLICATIONS.</h3>
</div>

<p>The day following, however, Nash found so much additional
work laid out for him that all other matters, especially
those of a personal nature, were relegated to the
background.</p>

<p>The &#8220;coyote&#8221; was exploded at eight o&#8217;clock that night,
and Nash sought his cabin an hour later, dead tired, but
with the satisfaction of knowing the carefully planned
drift and rock chamber had accomplished the purpose intended.
The double explosion had ripped off the mountaintop
in the twinkling of an eye. A hundred men in
a hundred days could not have duplicated the performance.</p>

<p>The job had been watched with a great deal of interest
by the engineers and foremen on the other sections of
the aqueduct, and Nash received a dozen telephone calls
congratulating him on the success of the undertaking.</p>

<p>He was just back in his quarters, when a knock sounded
on his door, and, opening it, he allowed a surprised exclamation
to escape him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Breen! Come right in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl obeyed him. She was dressed in her usual riding
habit. Her face did not have the usual color and life,
and her eyes were far from being alive and sparkling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Nash,&#8221; she began hurriedly, ignoring the chair he
had pulled out, &#8220;I&#8217;ve come to warn you. You&mdash;you must
get away before morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get away?&#8221; Nash frowned, then laughed. &#8220;And
why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you never going to take me seriously?&#8221; she demanded,
almost bitterly. &#8220;Have you forgotten what I
told you&mdash;last night on the top of the mountain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve not forgotten,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;but I half fancied
you were out of your head at the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you that the authorities at Los Angeles were
coming here&mdash;to arrest you. I meant it. They will be
here the first thing in the morning. That is why I rode
from the ranch to-night. You must not remain here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Breen,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;I cannot run away&mdash;I
would not run away. What you have said about my not
following the city specifications is absurd. I can prove it
to you. Let the authorities come. I will welcome any
investigation they may make.&#8221;</p>

<p>His calm voice seemed to puzzle her. She stood in the
center of the room, nervously fingering her heavy gloves.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am betraying my trust&mdash;in warning you,&#8221; she wavered.
&#8220;Why do you hesitate? You can easily ride into
San Fernando, and take the early train up to Frisco. It
may mean years of imprisonment if you remain in this
camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Believing me guilty, Miss Breen,&#8221; he ventured curiously
to ask, &#8220;why are you doing this?&#8221;</p>

<p>The first color came to her cheeks. &#8220;Because&mdash;I hate to
think&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you not try to aid me the other night? The
night I was about to capture the man who had smashed
our water mains? Why did you cry out that my gun
was unloaded&mdash;and allow him to escape?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I did not understand at the time. I had
met Mr. Macmillan at the ranch. He told me so many lies&mdash;lies
about you. I was foolish, and believed them. That
is why I was startled when I met you that first day on
the trail&mdash;the day my horse ran away. He told me there
was crooked work going on in the camp&mdash;and said you
were responsible. So when I saw him that night I felt
sorry for him. I called out and allowed him to get away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nash shook his head. &#8220;He did not get away&mdash;far,&#8221; he
answered. &#8220;I suppose you heard about&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded. &#8220;Yes. They brought his body to the
ranch to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Macmillan was an old subforeman in this camp when
I came here,&#8221; Nash explained. &#8220;I was put to work under
him. We had an argument, and I proved him to be in the
wrong. Mr. Hooker, then the foreman of the camp, discharged
him, and gave me his position. That explains
his hatred of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t have believed a word of his story&mdash;had
I not discovered the truth myself,&#8221; Miss Breen broke
out impulsively. &#8220;I liked you from the very first. You
seemed to be built of different stuff from most men. I
couldn&#8217;t believe that you would&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I would what, Miss Breen?&#8221; demanded Nash.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you would cheat your own city&mdash;the city you
loved so well. Why, I remember that day you pointed
out the work to me&mdash;and seemed so proud, so enthusiastic
over the construction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How have I cheated my city?&#8221; His tone was more
of a command now, and he felt the hot blood mounting
to his face. &#8220;How have I cheated my city, Miss Breen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember the day I examined the steel siphons&mdash;the
day you were showing me around the camp?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Nash instantly recalled to mind the interest Miss
Breen had shown in the work, and the unusual questions
she had asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The steel in those siphons is but seven-eighths of an
inch in thickness,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;The specifications call
for one and one-eighth inches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; Nash exclaimed. &#8220;That I should make
such a mistake as that is preposterous. I have my specifications
on file.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crossed the room, and took down the board upon
which he kept the statements pinned. &#8220;Here is the last
order from headquarters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hooker brought
them to me over a month ago.&#8221; He ran his finger down
the line of quotations. &#8220;Here&mdash;siphon steel for Soledad
Ca&ntilde;on&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped, frowning; then he peered nearer. Miss
Breen had followed him, and was looking over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;It says one-and-one-eighth-inch steel,&#8221; she declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but something&#8217;s wrong. These are not the specifications
I was given. They&#8217;ve been changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Changed? How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Nash suddenly clenched
his fingers. These were not the specifications given him
by Hooker; he could swear to that. These were not the
orders he had pinned to his board a few weeks previous.
Who had changed them? And why?</p>

<p>Some one was passing the cabin, whistling. Nash hurried
over, and jerked open the door. The man outside
was one of the foremen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Macklyn,&#8221; Nash called, &#8220;you&#8217;ve been around here
all day, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Why?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>&#8220;Seen any one around my cabin?&#8221;</p>

<p>Macklyn studied for the interval. &#8220;Can&#8217;t say as I have&mdash;that
is, nobody but Hooker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooker?&#8221; Nash repeated sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He was around here this afternoon. Saw him
go into your cabin&mdash;and then come out again in about ten
minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nash closed the door, and turned to face the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those specifications were changed this afternoon,&#8221; he
announced firmly, grimly. &#8220;And Hooker is the man who
changed them.&#8221;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII.<br />


A BOOK OF VERSES.</h3>
</div>

<p>Miss Breen waited a considerable time before she spoke.
Nash was so engrossed with his own thoughts that he
did not wonder at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why would Mr. Hooker change the specifications?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I can&#8217;t understand what motive might
prompt such a thing,&#8221; Nash admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in full authority here, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; Miss Breen
inquired.</p>

<p>Nash nodded. &#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this Mr. Hooker always brought you the orders
from Los Angeles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He was acting as a sort of secretary to Sigsbee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This Mr. Sigsbee is one of the aqueduct board,&#8221; Miss
Breen said. &#8220;He also interested himself in Camp Forty-seven.
I was given particular orders to watch the work
on this camp. I believe he was suspected of crooked
dealing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know he was,&#8221; Nash admitted. &#8220;It was being carried
on while I was under Hooker. I discovered the payroll
padding. When I threatened to disclose matters,
Sigsbee asked me to call at his Los Angeles office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was given full charge of the camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And also the full responsibility,&#8221; Miss Breen added
suddenly. &#8220;If anything went wrong, you would be held
to account.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nash admitted the truth of her statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t it appear to you that Mr. Sigsbee&#8217;s offer at that
time was rather&mdash;unusual?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I had expected to be discharged. But Sigsbee
seemed to be so anxious for me to accept&mdash;so sorry that
the crooked work had been unearthed. He declared that
from then on Camp Forty-seven was to be the model for
all others on the construction right of way. He wanted
me to run it on that basis, and promised that he would
stand by me to the last.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Breen listened, her face very grave. Finally she
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know that Sigsbee was interested in a steel
company?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I recall now that he mentioned something of the sort,&#8221;
Nash answered, a sudden suspicion entering his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in Los Angeles day before yesterday,&#8221; Miss
Breen said. &#8220;It was then I notified the authorities. Yesterday
I learned that Sigsbee had left for San Francisco,
and intended taking a trip to Honolulu. I wondered at
the time&mdash;now I have ceased to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Nash demanded, startled by her
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just this.&#8221; Miss Breen spoke rapidly, and with confidence.
Apparently she had a more intimate knowledge
of Sigsbee than Nash first imagined. The few remarks
Nash had dropped had helped to cement together her story.
&#8220;Camp Forty-seven has long been under suspicion. Sigsbee
must have been alarmed&mdash;and the first thing he sought to
do was to throw all the blame upon another&#8217;s shoulders.
You happened into the game at an inopportune moment.
He closed your mouth by putting you in charge here.
Then, to help matters along, he arranged these false specifications,
which you blindly followed. He knew discovery
was certain, and planned for it. It has happened. Sigsbee
is cleared of all blame. Everything will be shifted upon
your shoulders, Mr. Nash. The false specifications are
missing&mdash;the real ones are here. Sigsbee will swear, and
Hooker will undoubtedly back him up, that these correct
ones were the only ones sent. They&#8217;ve dropped you into
a cage, and you have sprung the trap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before she had half finished, Nash understood the situation.
It came to him swiftly, brutally. Sigsbee&#8217;s fawning
and Hooker&#8217;s honeyed words had been the strings with
which he had been led into the trap.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Miss Breen,&#8221; he said finally. &#8220;I&#8217;m caught&mdash;and
all but helpless. I have not one thing to prove that
I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl interrupted with a cry. &#8220;Oh, why, why didn&#8217;t
I wait until I knew for sure!&#8221; she stammered. &#8220;I took
everything for granted. I thought you guilty. Oh, you
can&#8217;t remain here, Mr. Nash. I am to blame for it all.
You cannot stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But wouldn&#8217;t it be an admission of guilt to run away?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;Of course it would. And I don&#8217;t intend to
do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but what chance have you against Sigsbee and his
political influence?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make a chance,&#8221; he answered firmly. &#8220;I&#8217;m innocent.
I&#8217;ve tried to do what was right. Things can&#8217;t be as black
as they look.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Breen walked up and down the floor for an interval;
then she stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one way out of this affair,&#8221; she ventured,
&#8220;and just one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nash nodded. &#8220;You mean&mdash;we&#8217;ve go to get those false
specifications! Isn&#8217;t that it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. We&#8217;ve got to get them. But that does not mean,&#8221;
she said, changing her tone, &#8220;that you are to stay here.
You get away before morning. I will try to find Hooker
and the papers. Once I have them I will let you know.
Then you can return.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nash shook his head gravely. &#8220;Impossible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, why do you act so foolish?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;It
may be months before we can locate those specifications.
Meanwhile they will hurry the trial, and you&#8217;ll be sentenced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am innocent. What have I to fear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the innocent man who always suffers,&#8221; she answered
bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t New York, Miss Breen,&#8221; Nash replied.
&#8220;They do things differently out here. I&#8217;m not afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Breen sank helplessly to a chair. &#8220;Why do you
always prate about the East and the West?&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;A crooked job is a crooked job, whether it is
staged in Los Angeles or New York. Sigsbee is a shrewd
man, and he has laid a shrewd trap. Yet you&#8217;re willing
to bow submissively, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She stopped suddenly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>During her speech her eyes had been upon the crudely
built bookcase. Abruptly she drew nearer, forgetting
apparently to continue what she had started. Her arm
shot out, and she plucked, from the row of other books,
the dainty, leather-bound copy of Kipling&#8217;s &#8220;Barrack-room
Ballads&#8221;&mdash;the book given to Nash by the tramp in
Central Park.</p>

<p>She opened it and rapidly thumbed the pages, stopping
at the one across which was written a name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&mdash;where did you get this book?&#8221; Miss Breen demanded,
her voice sounding husky.</p>

<p>Nash smiled. &#8220;Why, that book of poems? A panhandler
gave it to me one day in Los Angeles,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;Said he had found it on a bench.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In&mdash;in Central Park?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face was curiously white and drawn now. Nash
took a step nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you so interested?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;This book&mdash;belonged to my brother,&#8221; she wavered. &#8220;I
gave it to him&mdash;it was the last thing I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your brother?&#8221; Nash was dumfounded. Many times
since the first discovery of the name written in the little
book he had turned to it curiously; pondered over it,
wondered how and in what way Walter Trask&#8217;s volume
had crossed the width of the continent to find a lodging
place on a bench in Los Angeles. &#8220;Walter Trask&mdash;is
your brother?&#8221; he said slowly.</p>

<p>Miss Breen nodded. Her eyes were clouded with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the name&mdash;how&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Nash, puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Ethel Trask,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Because I was&mdash;was
in this business. I used the other&mdash;Miss Breen. I
had meant to tell you before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your brother, Miss Breen&mdash;I mean, Miss Trask,&#8221;
Nash questioned anxiously. &#8220;Was he an engineer on the
New York Aqueduct?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He worked there&mdash;until his death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nash caught his breath&mdash;but so light was the act that
the girl did not appear to notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Walter Trask&mdash;dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Trask nodded. Nash stood looking down at her,
preparing himself for the final question:</p>

<p>&#8220;How did he meet his death?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was killed in a brawl.&#8221; Miss Trask spoke slowly,
painfully, as if the recollection was a bitter one. &#8220;One of
the other engineers&mdash;shot him.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">COVERING A YAWNING MOUTH.</h3>
</div>


<p>A well-bred man puts his hand over his mouth when
he yawns, but not one well-bred man in ten thousand
knows why. The reason is this:</p>

<p>Four or five hundred years ago there was a superstition
common in Europe that the devil was always lying
in wait to enter a man&#8217;s body and take possession
of him.</p>

<p>Satan generally went in by the mouth, but when he had
waited a reasonable time and the man did not open his
mouth, the devil made him yawn, and when his mouth
was open, jumped down his throat.</p>

<p>So many cases of this kind occurred that the people
learned to make the sign of the cross over their mouths
whenever they yawned, in order to scare away the devil.</p>

<p>The peasantry in Italy and Spain still adhere to this
method, but most other people have dispensed with the
cross sign, and keep out the devil by simply placing the
hand before the lips. It is a most remarkable survival
of a practice after the significance has perished.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">A YOUNG FINANCIER.</h3>



<p>A certain man, in order to impress business methods
on his son early in life, told the youngster that if he
would see that the gas bill was paid before a certain
day each quarter, he could have the discount for himself.</p>

<p>The boy took very kindly to the idea, and captured
the discount every time the bill came in. To his father&#8217;s
surprise, however, the gas bill began to increase at a
remarkable rate. He found one night that his son was
burning gas all over the top of the house from ten o&#8217;clock
until six o&#8217;clock the next morning. The youngster had
become a Napoleon of finance, and had discovered the
fact that the bigger the bill the bigger the discount.</p>



<h3 class="nobreak">LAST WHITE RHINOCEROS.</h3>



<p>A wonderous brute, which only within the present
century emerged from the realm of myth into that of
scientific knowledge, has within the present year passed
into the realm of history. Reports from South Africa
declare that the last white rhinoceros has been killed, and
that its skeleton, hide, and horn are now being shipped
to England to enrich the Natural History Museum. Thus
the largest of modern quadrupeds, excepting the elephant,
becomes extinct, along with the beautiful quagga, the dodo,
the great auk, and other noteworthy members of the animal
kingdom which have vanished from the world before
the rapacity of man.</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">HOW A RUBBER FOREST LOOKS.</h3>



<p>According to recent accounts of the reckless manner in
which forests of rubber trees are destroyed, India rubber
will soon be much more scarce and costly than it now
is, and when that happens it is probable that some one
will invent a substitute. At present, however, it is interesting
to know what a recent traveler says of the
India-rubber forests of Nicaragua:</p>

<p>&#8220;A forest of them may be detected without the eyes
of an expert, for they are scarred and dying from the
wounds of the machete, the big knife used by the natives.
The ordinary specimen of Nicaragua is from fifty to one
hundred feet high, and about two feet in diameter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bark is white, and the leaves are oval, with
a slight inclination downward. The cuts are made about
two feet apart, and usually extend from the ground to
the first branch, channels being scored in the sides to lead
the juice into a bag. The average yield of a tree is
from five to seven gallons of milky fluid.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is mixed with the juice of the &#8216;wisth,&#8217; which hastens
congelation. After this operation the crude rubber
is baled up and shipped north, to be refined and further
prepared for commerce. Another tree, very similar to the
rubber, and often mistaken for it, is the cow tree. This
yields a liquid very much like milk in taste and appearance.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Renew War Idyll After Fifty Years.</h3>

<p>A romance of Civil War times will reach its climax
in Richmond, Va., when Miss Gillie Cary, once one of
the belles of Richmond, becomes the bride of Colonel W.
Gordon McCabe, former headmaster of McCabe&#8217;s University
School, who for some time past has been devoting
his time to literary pursuits, writing for English
and American magazines.</p>

<p>Sweethearts during the stirring days of 1861-&#8217;65, when
McCabe was a dashing young officer in Lee&#8217;s army, the
two are said to have been parted by a trivial lovers&#8217;
quarrel. The colonel, after the war, married Miss Virginia
Osborne, of Petersburg, where he established his
school and made it one of the best in the South, educating
many young men who have since risen high. In
1895 he moved the school to Richmond, and seven years
later retired from active work. In 1912 he lost his
wife.</p>

<p>Not many months ago Miss Cary, who had remained
true to her first love, was rummaging among old papers,
when she came upon a batch of poems that the young
officer of war days had written to her. Soon afterward
she met him and the old flame was fanned to new life.
The colonel once more became a suitor.</p>

<p>Now they are planning to spend their honeymoon in
Charleston, S. C., where one of the colonel&#8217;s sons is head
of a large cotton firm.</p>


<h3>Empress&#8217; Friend Dies in Poverty.</h3>

<p>Countess Jeanne Demadre, once belle of European
courts, convent mate, and friend of Princess Eugenie, who
later became wife of Napoleon III., died recently in a
humble cottage in a secluded spot in South Bend, Ind.
Few knew her, and none of her acquaintances realized
that half a century ago she was considered a world
beauty and the associate of the crowned heads of Europe.</p>

<p>A brief twelve-line obituary chronicled the death of
the woman, giving her name as Mrs. Peter Veuve and
her age as eighty-three. Her only surviving relative is
her heartbroken husband.</p>

<p>The countess was born the daughter of Count Hippolyte
Henri Demadre Desoursins, June 24, 1831, in the
mansion opposite the Royal Palace in Brussels, according
to the register of the Royal Church, in Brussels.</p>

<p>She was sent to a French convent, and there she became
a friend of Princess Eugenie, who was destined
later to become the wife of Napoleon III.</p>

<p>She left the convent when she was eighteen years
old, and when she was nineteen she became the wife
of a Frenchman named Baudin.</p>

<p>Her presentation at the court of Belgium took place
shortly after she left the convent, and after her school
friend Eugenie became the queen of Napoleon III., she
was presented at the French court and later at the
court of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>She invested a fortune in De Lesseps&#8217; Panama Canal
scheme after her husband died, and later she opened a
toilet shop in Paris, and, by catering to royalty, amassed
another fortune. During the Franco-Prussian War, she
became a nurse and was decorated with a gold medal.</p>

<p>Her son met with an accident in New York, and his
mother came to the United States to be with him when
he died. She later married Peter Veuve, a Swiss. The
latter made unwise investments, and twelve years ago,
practically penniless, the couple came to South Bend.</p>


<h3>How a Popular Preacher&#8217;s Mind Worked.</h3>

<p>How does a great preacher&#8217;s mind work? Insight into
this mystery is gained from the letters of the Reverend
Frederick Robertson, a popular preacher at Brighton,
England.</p>

<p>He died before he was forty, of brain disease brought
on by overwork, broken down by the nervous strain of
preaching.</p>

<p>Robertson wasted his strength very often in small controversies,
such as Sunday observance, and the unfortunate
fact that he had no sense of humor often led him
to take seriously and regret childishly, and answer bitterly,
criticisms which were not worth thinking about and
critics wholly unworthy of his steel.</p>

<p>Robertson himself knew that certain serious defects of
character are almost inseparable from the preacher&#8217;s
office.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I did not hate preaching so much,&#8221; he wrote
one day; &#8220;the degradation of being a Brighton preacher
is at times almost intolerable,&#8221; and, again he regrets that
he has weakened his nervous system by &#8220;stump oratory.&#8221;</p>

<p>Preaching always excited him, and a sermon would
leave him for days too much agitated to work. He
doubted often if he ought not to give it up&mdash;for the
sake of his spirit&mdash;though he would not attend to his
doctor&#8217;s advice and give it up for the sake of his body.</p>

<p>Blameless as was his life, and fruitful as were his
exhortations, he could not escape the minor dangers which
the pulpit shares with the stage. He grew sensitive and
self-centered, he came to need the stimulus of a crowd
moved to emotion.</p>

<p>Close as were his intimacies and wide as were his
benevolences, the circle of his affections was latterly narrow,
indeed. Yet he hated excitement as much as he
craved it. He wrote:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am persuaded there are few things morally so bad
as excitement of the nerves in any way; nothing&mdash;to borrow
a military word and use it in a military sense&mdash;nothing
demoralizes so much as excitement. It destroys the
tone of the heart; leaves an exhaustion which craves
stimulus, and utterly unfits for duty. High-wrought feeling
must end in wickedness; a life of excitement is inseparable
from a life of vice. The opera, the stage, the
ballroom, French literature, and irregular life&mdash;what must
they terminate in?&#8221;</p>


<h3>What Men Grind Their Axes On.</h3>

<p>Not many people realize that there is a special sort
of whetstone for nearly every purpose. The proper
sharpening stones or abrasives for use in various professions
and trades and in household work are exhibited in
the division of mineral technology in the older building
of the United States National Museum, at Washington,
D. C.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>The exhibit shows specimens of the crude and partially
prepared stones and the finished products ready for use,
as well as a series of photographs which illustrate
the operations of mining and preparing them.</p>

<p>Probably the first stone used for abrasive purposes was
sandstone, a very widely distributed rock, and it is still
used to-day. Its coarse grit and even grain first attracted
attention, while the rough edge that it gave was all that
was then required.</p>

<p>With the progress of the arts there began a search for
various stones which could be used for sharpening objects
of different sorts, so that to-day, not only sandstones,
but mica schists, slates, and emery stones are
used, besides several artificial compounds.</p>

<p>The hard, white, compact sandstones found near Hot
Springs, Arkansas, are among the best whetstones known,
equaling, if not surpassing, the Turkey stone, which for
years has been considered one of the best. This Arkansas
stone is known as novaculite, and occurs in two or three
grades, intended for use with certain tools.</p>

<p>The hard, flintlike stone should be used only to sharpen
instruments made of the very best steel, requiring very
keen edges and points, such as those used by surgeons,
dentists, and jewelers.</p>

<p>The other grades, although composed of the same ingredients,
are more porous, the sand grains are not as
close together, and a rougher edge is given to the
sharpened tool. Because of their more porous nature,
these stones cut faster, proving suitable for the finer-edged
tools of carpenters, machinists, and engravers, and
for honing razors.</p>

<p>Indiana and Ohio supply a whetstone made from a
sandstone of a coarser grain than the novaculite of
Arkansas, but nevertheless quite uniform. It may be used
with either oil or water, and is useful for sharpening
household cutlery, penknives, or ordinary carpenters&#8217; tools.
But since it is easily cut and grooved by hard and sharp
steel, the fine instruments of dentists and surgeons should
not be edged or pointed on this stone.</p>

<p>Scythe stones and mowing machine stones are practically
all made from mica-schist rock found in New
Hampshire and Vermont. These rocks are generally of
a dark-gray color, and composed of very thin sheets of
mica and quartz crystals interlaminated.</p>

<p>A simple experiment made about fifteen years ago led
to the discovery of carborundum and crystolon. By heating
a mixture of salt, sand, and sawdust, and powdered
coke in an electric furnace, the variegated colored crystals
of carborundum and crystolon were produced.</p>

<p>These crystals are extremely hard, cutting glass easily,
and, in fact, almost any substance except the diamond.</p>

<p>Emery cloth and paper are very well-known commodities,
but are little used to-day because the artificial
abrasives are just as effective and cheaper. Experiments
to obtain an artificial product having the main characteristics
of emery resulted in the making of alundom and
aloxite, both of which are shown in the museum series.</p>


<h3>High and Low California.</h3>

<p>California, with an area of 158,000 square miles, is the
second largest State in the Union. It exhibits wide
geographic diversity, for it includes the lowest area in the
United States&mdash;Death Valley, 276 feet below sea level&mdash;and
the highest&mdash;Mount Whitney, 14,501 feet above the
sea.</p>

<p>Similarly there is a great diversity in scenic effects,
climate, and vegetation. Records obtained at meteorologic
stations in the Salton Sink indicate a maximum temperature
of 130 degrees in the shade, the highest recorded
within the continental United States, while it is probable
that minimum temperature on the higher peaks, like Mount
Whitney and Mount Shasta, approach the minimum within
our boundaries, a total difference of nearly 200 degrees.</p>

<p>Records of rainfall in the most arid sections of the
southern deserts of the State represent the extreme of
aridity in the United States, showing an annual average
of less than three inches and periods of twelve months
or more, with only traces of rain, whereas the precipitation
in northwestern California is very heavy, an annual
average of close to one hundred inches being recorded
at a few stations in Mendocino and Del Norte Counties.</p>


<h3>The Boxing Bear.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Learn how to box! Latest tricks of the ring taught!
Exhibitions of shadow boxing with all the swings, jabs,
and hooks daily! Reasonable fees&mdash;honey, apples, and
all kinds of sweets accepted in unlimited quantities, honey
preferred. Professor Zip. Studio, Central Park.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill&#8221; Snyder, head keeper of the Central Park Zo&ouml;logical
Gardens, New York, N. Y., is the manager of Professor
Zip, while James Coyle, who looks after the bear
pen, is the active assistant of the professor. He has to
think quickly and act quickly, for professor knows all
the fine points of the boxing game, and when the keeper
faces him for his training bout every day, he has to be
on the alert. The professor knows the swings and jabs
and can sidestep and dodge with the best of the ring
artists.</p>

<p>Boxing is not the professor&#8217;s only accomplishment. He
is &#8220;some&#8221; dancer, too, and plays his own music, furnishing
original bear tunes for each lesson, playing it
himself and composing as the dance proceeds. You don&#8217;t
often find a boxing teacher who invents new dance steps
and hops, composes music, and plays it, too.</p>

<p>Zip does all these things, and, besides, has tricks galore.
For a nice red apple he&#8217;ll give an exhibition of shadow
boxing that would shame any star of the ring. For a bit
of candy he&#8217;ll turn somersaults and do all sorts of gymnastics,
but when honey is handed to him, he is in his
element, and that is the time he plays his bear tunes
and steps off in a way that the best tango &#8220;bug&#8221; would
envy.</p>

<p>Zip can be seen any day doing his &#8220;stunts&#8221; in the bear
pen at the Central Park menagerie. He is a small, black-brown
sloth bear, a new arrival at the park, for he has
been there little more than a month, but in that time he
has won more friends than any other animal in Bill
Snyder&#8217;s collection. He is particularly popular with the
children, who flock to his pen every afternoon to watch
him dance and box with &#8220;Jimmie&#8221; Coyle. One particular
friend of Zip is a young woman who visits the bear
pen every afternoon with a supply of honey. Once he
gets a taste of that, Zip goes through all his tricks.
He plays the harmonica, dances, does gymnastic stunts,
and then jerks &#8220;Buster,&#8221; his companion, to his feet and
proceeds to knock him all around the ring. For Buster
is a novice at the boxing game. Buster never could box
until Zip came. Then, when he found that Zip got all
the &#8220;sweets,&#8221; Buster became jealous, and one day tried to
beat Zip at his own game. But Buster is too old to learn.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
He can&#8217;t get any music out of the harmonica on which
Zip composes his dance music, and as for boxing, Zip
just uses him for a punching bag.</p>

<p>When Jimmie Coyle found that Zip was a boxer, he,
having ambitions in that line himself, went after the
bear in true ring fashion, but Zip knew too many tricks,
and, after giving Coyle a good pummelling the first two
or three days, to show him how little he knew about
the game, he permitted him to act as his trainer, so that
every day the keeper and the bear have a few rounds in
the pen, while Buster looks on and watches for pointers.</p>

<p>Zip was presented to the menagerie by Charles B. Knox,
of Jamestown, N. Y. Mr. Knox got the bear when he
was a cub, and in the next few months he became a great
pet of the family. He used to ride with Mr. Knox on
the front seat of his automobile and learned lots of
tricks. Mr. Knox also had a big Newfoundland dog,
&#8220;Jack,&#8221; and he and Zip became great chums; in fact, it
is said that Zip learned all his dance steps from Jack, for
they were often seen dancing together at Mr. Knox&#8217;s
home. Finally, however, Zip became too big for a household
pet, and it was feared that he might get too mischievous,
so Mr. Knox offered him to Bill Snyder, who
just then was looking for a bear to take the place of
Buster&#8217;s mate, who died about six weeks ago. So Zip
was shipped down to Central Park, and there he was in
his element at once, for all the kiddies who know every
animal in the park made friends with him and brought him
good things to eat as soon as they saw he could do so
many tricks.</p>

<h3>Fish Schools Choke Harbor.</h3>

<p>The city of Prince Rupert, B. C., Pacific coast terminal
of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, has once more witnessed
the yearly recurring phenomenon of having its
large harbor so densely packed with huge schools of
herring as to make the progress of rowboats a difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
matter. This year&#8217;s schools were exceptionally large, and
so dense that the immense body of fish seemed like one
solid moving mass. Men and boys on the G. T. P. docks
hauled in literally millions of these fish in buckets, wire
waste-paper baskets, and almost any utensil that was
handy.</p>

<p>Some of these herrings were taken by the fish companies
and frozen in boxes for use as bait in fishing for
halibut. They are an excellent table fish, but so far
comparatively few of them are being shipped, although
several inland cities have made inquiries. Fishermen say
that the herring took sheltered bays to escape the whales
which prey on them in certain localities in the Pacific during
their migrations.</p>

<h3>Tricks of a Two-legged Cat.</h3>

<p>J. A. Hart, who lives about six miles south of Eureka,
Kan., has a freak of nature in the shape of a two-legged
kitten that walks, jumps, and frisks about like any normal
kitten. The kitten is now about three months old, is
plump and well grown, and appears to be a normal, healthy
kitten in every respect except that it hasn&#8217;t the vestige
of a hip bone or hind legs, and, what is more strange, it
does not seem to feel the need of another pair of legs and
feet any more than a duck or any other biped.</p>

<p>It walks about on the two front feet with easy, graceful
equipoise, waving its tail over its back. When it
pauses, it sits down naturally, and the casual observer
might not notice the absence of the hind legs and feet.
One mate to this kitten is normal in every respect, but
another one of the same litter lacked the hip bones and
hind legs. This kitten was growing nicely, but was
accidentally caught in a trap and died from the injuries.
Had it lived, the two would have made a strange pair of
kittens.</p>


<h3>Facts About the Human Eye.</h3>

<p>People of melancholic temperament rarely have clear
blue eyes.</p>

<p>The chameleon is almost the only reptile provided with
an eyelid.</p>

<p>Eyes with long, sharp corners indicate great discernment
and penetration.</p>

<p>Unsteady eyes, rapidly jerking from side to side, are
frequently indicative of an unsettled mind.</p>

<p>It is said that the prevailing colors of eyes among
patients of lunatic asylums are brown and black.</p>

<p>Eyes placed close together in the head are said to indicate
pettiness of disposition, jealousy, and a turn for
fault finding.</p>

<p>All men of genius are said to have eyes clear, slow
moving, and bright. This is the eye which indicates mental
ability of some kind&mdash;it does not matter what.</p>


<h3>One Horse Power Per Second.</h3>

<p>To lift 550 pounds one foot in one second requires
what is known as one horse power. Similarly, a horse
power is able to raise twice that weight one foot in twice
the time or one-half foot in just that time. Moreover,
it can raise half 550 pounds one foot in half a second,
or two feet in a second, and so on. Therefore, when
we lift one-fourth of that weight, 137&frac12; pounds, four
feet in one second, we are exerting a horse power.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when a person who weighs 137&frac12; pounds
runs upstairs at the rate of four feet a second, he is exerting
the equivalent of a horse power. For a man weighing
twice that much, 275 pounds, it would be necessary
to climb at the rate of only two feet a second to exert
a horse power. It is possible to do much more.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, a horse often exerts many times a
horse power. The average horse can draw a wagon
up a hill where a ten-horse power engine with the same
load would fail. A horse power does not represent the
greatest momentary strength of the average horse, but is
a measure of the power which he can exert continuously.</p>


<h3>Dream of Wealth Comes True.</h3>

<p>To be a poor little girl with the poor little girl&#8217;s dream
of some day becoming a princess with untold wealth and
then to suddenly find that the wealthy part of the dream
has come true, is the experience of fifteen-year-old Josephine
Romano, of Boston, Mass.</p>

<p>Josephine&#8217;s dream of wealth came true when she was
awarded $16,000 by a jury for injuries sustained several
years ago when she was hit and tripped by a live wire
which was dangling from one of the Boston elevated
poles. She was so severely burned about the head, face,
and hands that the marks will remain on her body
for life.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is so much money that I don&#8217;t know what to do
with it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll put it in the bank and then
be a real lady.&#8221;</p>


<h3>Spain Faces Hunger Peril.</h3>

<p>The economic situation in Spain is becoming steadily
more serious, notwithstanding the efforts of the government
to find a solution for the difficulties which confront
the country. It is feared that conditions will soon become
so bad that they may lead to a conflict fraught with
grave consequences.</p>

<p>Dispatches from the provinces tell of numerous riots
resulting from the high cost of food. In some interior
districts and in the Canary Islands the people get food
only every other day. Many families are said to be living
on herbs and roots. A woman said to have been
driven mad by privation, drowned herself with her children
at Lazaretos.</p>

<p>Fierce rioting resulted at Lacele from the increased
price of bread. The civil guards are reported to have fired
into the crowd, killing one and wounding many.</p>


<h3>Hen Egg Like a Goose Egg.</h3>

<p>Miss Alma Brewer, of Como, Miss., is proudly exhibiting
a common hen&#8217;s egg which she recently found in
a nest which measures six and three-fourth inches around
and seven and five-eighths inches the long way.</p>


<h3>Russian Pillager is Hanged.</h3>

<p>A more favorable view of the discipline in the Russian
army in Galicia than prevailed during the autumn
invasion of East Prussia is given by Leonhard Adelt, the
war correspondent of the <i>Tageblatt</i>, who recently visited
Neu-Sandec, on the Dunajec River, a short time after it
had been evacuated by the Russian army.</p>

<p>At the corner of one street he saw a hook fastened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
the wall, from which, as he was informed by the citizens,
the Russians had hanged one of their soldiers for
plundering. There was still visible on the adjacent wall
the following inscription:</p>

<p>&#8220;The czar sent out soldiers, not pillagers, to fight for
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelt goes on to say that the Russians maintained
strict discipline in the city. As further examples of their
stringency, he mentions that one soldier who stole a ham
was given fifty strokes with the knout, while another,
who strayed into the quarters of other soldiers and made
undue noise there, got thirty strokes.</p>

<p>In Bukowina the Russians demonstrated the sincerity
of their newly acquired temperance principles by emptying
all strong liquors into the gutters.</p>


<h3>Prisoner Dies from Wounds.</h3>

<p>The German prisoner who was shot through the lungs
some time ago by a sentry while trying to escape from
the internment camp near Kingston, Jamaica, is dead from
his wounds. He persisted in stoning the guard who shot
him. Since this affair, no other attempts to escape have
been made.</p>


<h3>How Many Auto Tires We Use.</h3>

<p>In round numbers there are now 1,600,000 automobiles
in the country, and not one of them can possibly get
along with less than four tires a year. The most conservative
estimate must place the number per car at six
tires a year. This would be 9,600,000 tires. In addition,
there are scheduled for manufacture during 1915 not less
than 600,000 new cars, which must be fitted with at least
2,400,000 new tires, making a total of at least 12,000,000
tires. In reality, the number is much greater, even though
a million or more tires are &#8220;retreaded,&#8221; fitted with
&#8220;covers,&#8221; et cetera. Taxicabs and some of the high-powered
converted racing cars could not possibly get
along with less than twenty tires a year. The money
spent for tires in 1914 in the United States alone probably
exceeded $200,000,000.</p>


<h3>London Will Retain German Street Names.</h3>

<p>The London County Council is not encouraging the
changing of German street names. Despite the fact that
the borough council of Stoke Newington requested that
Wiesbaden Road should be renamed Beatty Road, after
the naval hero, the local government committee, in a
report that will be submitted to-day, says it is not satisfied
that a sufficient cause for alteration has been made
out.</p>

<p>Recently the county council decided to take no action
with regard to renaming Berlin Road Gatford Road.
Suggestions have been made by many citizens to change
the names of Hanover Square and St. Petersburg Place.</p>


<h3>Big Ancient Statue is Found.</h3>

<p>Libya, in Africa, again has given an ancient piece of
sculpture to the world. At Cyrene, once the principal
city of ancient Cyrenaica, a colossal statue of Alexander
the Great, lacking only a part of the right forearm, has
been excavated. It is a magnificent marble copy of the
celebrated bronze of Alexander by Lysippus, which is
known only by the copies of it on coins, the original having
been destroyed.</p>

<p>The statue probably was made fifty or sixty years after
the original, in the third or fourth century before Christ.
It is larger than life and represents Alexander, entirely
nude, standing, looking upward, with his right arm outstretched
and his left holding a spear, on which he is
leaning.</p>


<h3>Boy Scouts Paid More than Middies.</h3>

<p>Boy scouts are now engaged in the navy of Great
Britain for signaling and are receiving more pay than
midshipmen. More than 12,000 scouts have entered military
service of one kind or another, and 2,000 more who
are nearing the age of enlistment are in training.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the war the scouts by thousands
guarded telegraphs, telephones, and bridges, served as
messengers, and performed countless duties of value to
the war office and the admiralty. More than 5,000 medals
have been given to scouts who performed not less than
twenty-eight days of service. About 50,000 boys have
served a fewer number of days.</p>

<p>The sea branch of the movement volunteered to carry
out the duties of the coast guardsmen recalled to the
fleet, and they were detailed to duties on the east coast.
This required more boys than this branch could supply,
and the land scouts joined, and now 1,600 boys are so
employed in patrols of eight, under their own leaders
and with their own equipment.</p>


<h3>Catch White-and-black Rat.</h3>

<p>The colored porter at H. T. Whitfield&#8217;s billiard room,
in Murfreesboro, Tenn., captured a freak rat. The
rodent&#8217;s head and front part of its body is pure black,
while the other half is snow white, excepting a black line
running along the center of its back to the tail. The
rat is still in captivity, and the owner has been offered
ten dollars for it. When caught, it was very vicious and
made several attempts to bite its captor.</p>


<h3>Three-mouthed Calf Born.</h3>

<p>Will Pline, a farmer living five miles from Lebanon,
Mo., was surprised on finding that one of his newborn
calves has three mouths, and was as spry as any calf in
his herd.</p>

<p>The mouths are all on the front of the animal&#8217;s head,
one being up between the horns and another just below
that, and the third a little lower down.</p>

<p>Mr. Pline feeds the calf milk, which it seems to relish
as any ordinary calf. It seems as though the animal will
live, for when any one enters the lot where it is kept, it
will run and play as though it felt healthy and strong.</p>


<h3>Tells of Cat-and-dog Wedding.</h3>

<p>A cat and a dog can be friendly&mdash;aye, even more. The
old argument was settled here with a statement from
Reverend Father Bernard of the Fort Yates Catholic
Church, of Fort Yates, N. D., that he had just married
Miss Rose High Cat to Harry Poor Dog. They are
Sioux Indians.</p>


<h3>Sends Forest to Fair.</h3>

<p>To accommodate visitors at the Panama-Pacific Exposition,
the Southern Pacific Railway Company has constructed
a building, 200 feet square and in classic style,
standing between the west portal of the Zone and the
Machinery Palace.</p>

<p>The structure has a cozy rest room for women, with
a nurse in charge, and is furnished with writing desks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
easy-chairs, and newspapers from all parts of the United
States. There is a similar room for men.</p>

<p>The entrance leads through the heart of a California
big tree. The whole inclosure is a miniature woodland,
with trails winding among the trees. Through this woodland
a path leads to the offices of the company, where a
squad of information clerks are ready to answer all
questions.</p>

<p>Opening out of the ticket office is Sunset Theater, a
replica of The Little Theater, in New York City, where
stereopticon scenes and motion pictures are presented.
The company has engaged lecturers, and their talks are
interspersed with musical selections rendered on the
great Kimball pipe organ.</p>


<h3>It&#8217;s Fish, Snake, or Lizard.</h3>

<p>A strange creature, presenting anatomical characteristics
which might be attributed to fish, snake, or lizard,
has been placed on exhibition in a business house in Bicknell,
Ind. No one has found a name that seems to fit
the animal, or reptile, which was caught by Grant Hooper
and Carl York, fishermen.</p>

<p>The body of the creature is twelve inches long, and in
shape resembles the old-fashioned four-cornered dart kite.
The head, in form, is like a snake&#8217;s, but the resemblance
ends there, for four sharp tusks protrude from the mouth.
Apparently the creature breathes through gills similar
to those of a fish. The horns and ears, which follow
closely the forms of the human ear, give a peculiar appearance
to the head. The skin or hide is black and white
in color.</p>


<h3>Big Gun Crumples Car.</h3>

<p>So heavy is a great fourteen-inch gun just completed,
to guard New York City from hostile attack, that it broke
down one of the two flat cars conveying it along the
West Shore Railroad, near Cornwall, on its way to Sandy
Hook, to be mounted.</p>

<p>It is said to be the most powerful fourteen-inch gun
ever made. It was on its way from Watervliet Arsenal
when the journal of one of the cars, overtaxed by its
excessive weight, wore out and had to be replaced. The
gun extends almost the length of the two cars, the breech
resting on the rear one.</p>


<h3>Old Man Hangs Up a Walking Record.</h3>

<p>Becoming peeved over the fact that the Big Four Railroad
did not have a train scheduled to leave at a
time when he desired to return to his home, Benjamin
Yentzer hung up a walking record for one of his
age. Although eighty-seven, he walked from Tiffin to
Adrian, Ohio, twelve miles, and made the journey in two
hours. He was feeling fine at the end of the walk,
too.</p>


<h3>Cover Held on Kettle.</h3>

<p>Much of the flavor and other virtues of meat and
vegetables are lost while undergoing the cooking operation,
being carried away in the escaping vapor and heat.
In a recently invented kettle, a lid is sealed on under
pressure. This prevents the escape of steam and facilitates
the cooking process. It is claimed that not only is
the cooking done in much shorter time, but that foods
prepared in this manner have a more delicate flavor. The
lid is held in place by means of a lever which is easily
manipulated. In order to prevent the possibility of an explosion
when the kettle is on the stove, the lid is fitted
with automatic safety valve which permits the steam to
blow off when the pressure approaches the danger
point.</p>


<h3>Passes Her 106 Birthday.</h3>

<p>Still enjoying good health at the great age of 106 years,
Mrs. Abigail Morrill passed another milestone, and has
the distinction of being the oldest person in Newburyport,
Mass.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morrill was born on a farm in West Newbury in
1809, and has lived in this vicinity all her life. She has
for several years resided with her daughter, Mrs. Abby
Morrill Oliver.</p>

<p>She is the mother of ten children, three of whom are
now living; Mrs. Oliver, of this city, Louis Morrill, of
West Newbury, and George Morrill, of Lynn, the two
sons being survivors of the Civil War.</p>

<p>Her husband was the late Jacob Morrill, of this city,
to whom she was married May 4, 1835. There are eleven
grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. Except for
being slightly hard of hearing, Mrs. Morrill has her faculties
well preserved.</p>


<h3>Stove in Shaving Mug.</h3>

<p>The newest shaving mug is equipped with a little alcohol
lamp. So little water is required that it takes but a
short time to heat it to the boiling temperature. The invention
is one that will be appreciated by traveling men
especially, as the mug is not much larger than the ordinary
kind, and is, of course, much easier to carry about than
shaving outfits. In fact, it seems odd that the invention
was not thought of before. The interior of the cup is
of a substance not injured by heat, and the lamp is lighted
from the bottom. Hot water may thus be obtained at
any time in a few seconds.</p>


<h3>Sneezed Out a War Souvenir.</h3>

<p>After carrying a bullet in his head for nearly fifty
years, or ever since the battle of Gettysburg, Calvin Cook,
a Confederate soldier living in Catawba County, N. C.,
has sneezed from his nose a leaden pellet commonly
called &#8220;buckshot.&#8221; He was wounded in the head at Gettysburg
and eventually recovered from the wound, only
to be troubled many years by what was designated as
some sort of growth in his nasal passages. During a recent
sneezing fit he &#8220;blew&#8221; his nose with uncommon
vigor, and out rolled his souvenir of the greatest battle
of the Civil War. His nasal trouble vanished when the
&#8220;growth&#8221; rolled out.</p>

<h3>Tobacco Habit Easily Conquered</h3>



<p>A New Yorker of wide experience, has written a
book telling how the tobacco or snuff habit may be
easily and completely banished in three days with
delightful benefit. The author, Edward J. Woods,
230 G, Station E, New York City, will mail his book
free on request.</p>

<p>The health improves wonderfully after the nicotine
poison is out of the system. Calmness, tranquil sleep,
clear eyes, normal appetite, good digestion, manly
vigor, strong memory and a general gain in efficiency
are among the many benefits reported. Get rid of that
nervous feeling; no more need of pipe, cigar, cigarette,
snuff or chewing tobacco to pacify morbid desire.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
